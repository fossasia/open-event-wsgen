It seems that not all Silicon Valley tycoons fully understand that \u201cwith great power comes great responsibilities\u201d (as Spiderman\u2019s Uncle Ben used to say). Literally billions of people use free services such as Facebook and Google without understanding that they\u2019re not customers of these services. Advertisers are. To make money, these companies sell targeted advertising. To target us, they want to know everything about each of us, so they capture as much personal data as they can in huge silos to analyze the data. It\u2019s what we call \u201cSurveillance capitalism\u201d. The Snowden revelations have been interesting as they showed that first the NSA (U.S. National Security Agency) wants to spy on everyone, but it\u2019s very costly. To do so, they leverage the data collection already done by Internet giants. In short, mass surveillance is made economically possible thanks to data centralization. I wanted to explain all that to ordinary people. Then I wanted to explain what each of us could do to limit our dependence to the Internet giants, by using decentralized tools and systems that are not made to collect data about us and influence us.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"\"></span></p><p><span style=\"\"></span></p>", "speakers": [{"short_biography": "", "photo": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/181/speakers/2631/photo/U2dMenVWQW/8c41523d-8066-4d8d-9790-e74a274d132c.png", "sponsorship_required": "", "id": 2631, "icon": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/181/speakers/2631/icon/d3JUVm5NV0/769fb413-8a09-4e0f-8fe5-876b5ff8cfe6.jpg", "city": null, "name": "Tristan Nitot", "speaking_experience": "", "organisation": "", "long_biography": "", "heard_from": null, "small": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/181/speakers/2631/small/ZlJWRDNYSm/f5fd9393-263a-4352-bbb1-2ca125f02404.jpg", "thumbnail": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/181/speakers/2631/thumbnail/NGJNYlVJZW/fe432d2a-6cc8-4907-aac1-f129ca57fa10.jpg"}], "subtitle": "", "language": "", "title": "Keynote - Come build the future of private Clouds", "track": {"color": "#EF6C00", "font_color": "#000000", "id": 484, "name": "Main Track"}, "start_time": "2017-08-26T10:30:00+00:00", "level": "", "comments": "", "slides": null, "state": "confirmed", "microlocation": {"id": 406, "name": "Main Room"}, "end_time": "2017-08-26T10:45:00+00:00", "video": null, "audio": null, "signup_url": null, "id": 3738, "long_abstract": ""}, {"session_type": {"length": "00:05", "id": 328, "name": "Lightning talks"}, "short_abstract": "<p>In this lightning talk, you'll learn how you can store sensitive files in your Nextcloud by using Cryptomator's client-side encryption.

and a database cluster attached to multiple application servers behind a load balancer. This allows organisations to scale Nextcloud\u00a0 for thousands of users. But at some point the shared components like the storage, database and load balancer become a expensive bottleneck. Therefore Nextcloud introduced \"Global Scale\", a new way to scale large installations based on the unique federated sharing feature beyond this limitations. Federated sharing combined with our new developed \"Lookup Server\" and the \"Global Site Selector\" allows you to set up many small Nextcloud server based on commodity hardware and connect them to one large system. This enables organisations to scale the system to hundreds of millions of users and reduce complexity and costs dramatically.
