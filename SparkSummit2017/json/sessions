These factors have led to an explosion in the volume of genetic data, in the face of which existing analysis tools are breaking down. As a result, the Broad Institute began the open-source Hail project (https://hail.is), a scalable platform built on Apache Spark, to enable the worldwide genetics community to build, share and apply new tools. Hail is focused on variant-level (post-read) data; querying genetic data, as well as annotations, on variants and samples; and performing rare and common variant association analyses. Hail has already been used to analyze datasets with hundreds of thousands of exomes and tens of thousands of whole genomes, enabling dozens of major research projects.",

However, since many compression algorithms with good compression ratio are also very CPU-intensive, developers are often forced to use algorithms that are less CPU-intensive at the cost of reduced compression ratio.\n\nIn this session, you’ll learn about a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based approach for accelerating data compression in Spark. By opportunistically offloading compute-heavy, compression tasks to the FPGA, the CPU is freed to perform other tasks, resulting in an improved overall performance for end-user applications. In contrast to existing GPU methods for acceleration, this approach affords more performance/energy efficiency, which can translate to significant savings in power and cooling costs, especially for large datacenters. In addition, this implementation offers the benefit of reconfigurability, allowing for the FPGA to be rapidly reprogrammed with a different algorithm to meet system or user requirements.\n\nUsing the Intel Xeon+FPGA platform, Ojika will share how they ported Swif (simplified workload-intuitive framework) to Spark, and the method used to enable an end-to-end, FPGA-aware Spark deployment. Swif is an in-house framework developed to democratize and simplify the deployment of FPGAs in heterogeneous datacenters. Using Swif’s application programmable interface (API), he’ll describe how system architects and software developers can seamlessly integrate FPGAs into their Spark workflow, and in particular, deploy FPGA-based compression schemes that achieve improved performance compared to software-only approaches. In general, Swif’s software stack, along with the underlying Xeon+FPGA hardware platform, provides a workload-centric processing environment that streamlines the process of offloading CPU-intensive tasks to shared FPGA resources, while providing improved system throughput and high resource utilization.",

Learn how easy it is to go from single-threaded, memory-bound R functions to multi-threaded, multi-node, out-of-memory applications that can be deployed in a distributed cluster environment with minimal amount of code changes.

		"long-abstract": "Nomad is a modern cluster manager by HashiCorp, designed for both long-lived services and short-lived batch processing workloads. The Nomad team has been working to bring a native integration between Nomad and Apache Spark.\n\nBy running Spark jobs on Nomad, both Spark developers and the engineering organization benefit. Nomad’s architecture allows it to have an incredibly high scheduling throughput. To demonstrate this, HashiCorp scheduled 1 million containers in less than five minutes. That speed means that large Spark workloads can be immediately placed, minimizing job runtime and job start latencies.\n\nFor an organization, Nomad offers many benefits. Since Nomad was designed for both batch and services, a single cluster can service both an organization’s Spark workload and all service-oriented jobs. That, coupled with the fact that Nomad uses bin-packing to place multiple jobs on each machine, means that organizations can achieve higher density. Which saves money and makes capacity planning easier.\n\nIn the future, Nomad will also have the ability to enforce quotas and apply chargebacks, allowing multi-tenant clusters to be easily managed. To further increase the performance of Spark on Nomad, HashiCorp would like to ingest HDFS locality information to place the compute by the data.",

Bucketing can enable faster joins (i.e. single stage sort merge join), the ability to short circuit in FILTER operation if the file is pre-sorted over the column in a filter predicate, and it supports quick data sampling.\n\nIn this session, you’ll learn how bucketing is implemented in both Hive and Spark. In particular, Patil will describe the changes in the Catalyst optimizer that enable these optimizations in Spark for various bucketing scenarios. Facebook’s performance tests have shown bucketing to improve Spark performance from 3-5x faster when the optimization is enabled. Many tables at Facebook are sorted and bucketed, and migrating these workloads to Spark have resulted in a 2-3x savings when compared to Hive. You’ll also hear about real-world applications of bucketing, like loading of cumulative tables with daily delta, and the characteristics that can help identify suitable candidate jobs that can benefit from bucketing.",

This talk will explain the problems that are caused by the available committers when writing to S3, and show how Netflix solved the committer problem.\n\nIn this session, you’ll learn:\n– Some background about Spark at Netflix\n– About output committers, and how both Spark and Hadoop handle failures\n– How HDFS and S3 differ, and why HDFS committers don’t work well\n– A new output committer that uses the S3 multi-part upload API\n– How you can use this new committer in your Spark applications to avoid duplicating data",

However, it’s difficult to manage petabyte-scale Hadoop clusters with hundreds of edge nodes, multiple Spark releases and demonstrate operational efficiencies and standardization. In order to address these challenges, Paypal has developed and deployed a REST0based Spark platform: Spark Compute as a Service (SCaaS),which provides improved application development, execution, logging, security, workload management and tuning.\n\nThis session will walk through the top challenges faced by PayPal administrators, developers and operations and describe how Paypal’s SCaaS platform overcomes them by leveraging open source tools and technologies, like Livy, Jupyter, SparkMagic, Zeppelin, SQL Tools, Kafka and Elastic. You’ll also hear about the improvements PayPal has added, which enable it to run greater than 10,000 Spark applications in production effectively.",

They have a large team of around 80 data scientists who own their pipelines from start to finish; there is no “ETL engineering team” that takes over. As a result, Stitch Fix has developed a self-service approach with their infrastructure to make it easy for the team to submit and track jobs, and they’ve grown an internal community of Spark users to help each other get started with the use of Spark.\n\nIn this session, you’ll learn about Stitch Fix’s approach to using and managing Spark, including their infrastructure, execution service and other supporting tools. You’ll also hear about the types of capabilities they support with Spark, how the team transitioned to using Spark, and lessons learned along the way.

The rise of social networks and the Internet of Things has given us complex web-scale graphs with billions of vertices and edges. However, in order to extract the hidden gems within those graphs, you need tools to analyze the graphs easily and efficiently.\n\nAt Spark Summit 2016, Databricks introduced GraphFrames, which implemented graph queries and pattern matching on top of Spark SQL to simplify graph analytics. In this talk, you’ll learn about work that has made graph algorithms in GraphFrames faster and more scalable. For example, new implementations like connected components have received algorithm improvements based on recent research, as well as performance improvements from Spark DataFrames. Discover lessons learned from scaling the implementation from millions to billions of nodes; compare its performance with other popular graph libraries; and hear about real-world applications.",

This session will describe a novel algorithm for enumerating walks on large-scale graphs that benefits from the several unique abilities of Apache Spark.\n\nThe algorithm generates a recursive branching DAG of stages that separates out the “closed” and “open” walks. Spark’s shuffle file management system is ingeniously used to accumulate the walks while the computation is progressing. In-memory caching over multi-core executors enables moving the walks several “steps” forward before shuffling to the next stage.\n\nSee performance benchmarks, and hear about LinkedIn’s experience with Spark in production clusters. The session will conclude with an observation of how Spark’s unique and powerful construct opens new models of computation, not possible with state-of-the-art, for developing high-performant and scalable algorithms in data science and machine learning.",
