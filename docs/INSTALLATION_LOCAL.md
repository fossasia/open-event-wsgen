# How to install the Open Event Web App Generator on my local machine

## Deploying Locally

First install the dependencies.

```shell
npm install or npm install bcrypt
npm install --save-dev
```
if you get an error, then fix npm permissions globally. Then restart from step 1.
refer this:"https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions"

Sometimes it may give an error of fetch failed
then type

```shell
npm config set registry http://registry.npmjs.org/
```

and then restart the terminal and start from step 1

Run the app

```shell
npm run start
```
or
```shell
npm run server.generator
```

The app will be running on http://localhost:5000

Note : If you are running the app behind a proxy, set the proxy option in config.json to `http://username:password@proxy_url:proxy_port`, and make sure it is url encoded.

## Requirements

| Component  | Name/Flavour | Minimum Version |
|---|---|---|
|  OS | Mac/Windows/Linux | Any |
| Node.js |  | v4.0 (or above) |
| Browser | Firefox/Chrome/Safari | 21+/11+/9+

Note: Computers running on **Windows OS** may encounter problems when installing the Webapp Generator on local machines. As Windows does not come bundled with a C++ compiler, which is needed in NodeJS, the command prompt may throw up a error which states that `node-gyp rebuild` fails on your system. Hence it is advised a further prerequisite (for Windows users) is to download Visual Studio Community 2015 which contains a C++ compiler (link is https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).

Note: If you are using **Windows OS** and getting errors like `gyp ERR! configure error` or `gyp ERR! stack Error: Can't find Python executable "python"` then you can now install all node-gyp dependencies with these commands:
(Run As Admin in Windows PowerShell)

```shell
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
```
and then install the package
```shell
npm install --global node-gyp
```
