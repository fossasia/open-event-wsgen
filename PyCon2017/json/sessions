    "short-abstract": "Today we use cryptography in almost everywhere. From surfing the web over https, to working remotely over ssh. Although most developers don't need to implement cryptography primitives, the knowledge and understanding of these building block allows them to better deploy them in their application. In modern crypto we have all the building block to develop secure application. However, we see instances of insecure code everywhere. Most of these vulnerabilities are not because of theoretic shortcomings, but due to bad implementation or a flawed protocol design. Cryptography is a delicate art where nuances matter, and failure to comprehend the subtleties of these building blocks leads to critical vulnerabilities. To add insult to injury most of the resources available are either outdated or wrong, and inarguably, using bad crypto more dangerous than not using it.In this tutorial we look at the basic building blocks of modern cryptography. We will cover the encryption techniques, hashing mechanisms, and key devastation algorithms. Furthermore we review two of the most widely used protocol suites, SSL and PGP. We conclude by implementing a simplified version of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), that is used for encryption of texts, e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions.",

    "short-abstract": "Python developers use decorators and descriptors on a daily basis, but many don't understand them well enough to create (or debug) them. Decorators are widely deployed in popular Python Web frameworks. Descriptors are the key to the database mappers used with those frameworks, but under the covers they play an even more crucial role in Python as the device that turns plain functions into bound methods, setting the value of the self argument. This tutorial is a gentle introduction these important language features, using a test-driven presentation and exercises, and covering enhancements in Python 3.6 that make class metaprogramming easier to get right.Decorators without closures are presented first, highlighting the difference between run time and import time that is crucial when meta-programming. We then get a firm grounding on closures and how they are implemented in Python, before moving to higher order function decorators and class decorators. Coverage of descriptors starts with a close look at Python's property built-in function and dynamic attribute look up. We then implement some ORM-like field validation descriptors, encounter a usability problem, and leverage PEP 487 -- Simpler customisation of class creation -- to solve it. Alternative implementations using a class decorator and a metaclass will be contrasted to the PEP 487 solution.",

    "short-abstract": "With the recent advancements in machine learning algorithms and statistical techniques, and the increasing ease of implementing them in Python, it is tempting to ignore the power and necessity of exploratory data analysis (EDA), the crucial step before diving into machine learning or statistical modeling. Simply applying machine learning algorithms without a proper orientation of the dataset can lead to wasted time and spurious conclusions. EDA allows practitioners to gain intuition for the pattern of the data, identify anomalies, narrow down a set of alternative modeling approaches, devise strategies to handle missing data, and ensure correct interpretation of the results. Further, EDA can rapidly generate insights and answer many questions without requiring complex modeling. Python is a fantastic language not only for machine learning, but also EDA. In this tutorial, we will walk through two hands-on examples of how to perform EDA using Python and discuss various EDA techniques for cross-section data, time-series data, and panel data. One example will demonstrate how to use EDA to answer questions, test business assumptions, and generate hypotheses for further analysis. The other example will focus on performing EDA to prepare for modeling. Between these two examples, we will cover: Data profiling and quality assessment, Basic describing of the data, Visualizing the data including interactive visualizations, Identifying patterns in the data (including patterns of correlated missing data), Dealing with many attributes (columns), Dealing with large datasets using sampling techniques, Informing the engineering of features for future modeling, Identifying challenges of using the data (e.g. skewness, outliers), Developing an intuition for interpreting the results of future modeling. The intended audience for this tutorial are aspiring and practicing data scientists and analysts, or anyone who wants to be able to get insights out of data. Students must have at least an intermediate-level knowledge of Python and some familiarity with analyzing data would be beneficial. Installation of Jupyter Notebook will be required (and potentially, we will also demonstrate analysis in JupyterLab, if its development in the next few months allows). Instructions will be sent on what packages to install beforehand.",

And while the web offers a seemingly boundless source for custom data sets, the collection of that data can present a whole host of obstacles. From ever-changing APIs to rate-limiting woes, from nightmarishly nested XML to convoluted DOM trees, working with APIs and web scraping are challenging but critically useful skills for application developers and data scientists alike. In this tutorial, we’ll introduce RESTful APIs, RSS feeds, and web scraping in order to see how different ingestion techniques impact application development. We’ll explore how and when to use Python libraries such as feedparser, requests, beautifulsoup, and urllib. And finally we will present common data collection problems and how to overcome them. We’ll take a hands-on, directed exercise approach combined with short presentations to engage a range of different APIs (with and without authentication), explore examples of how and why you might web scrape, and learn the ethical and legal considerations for both. To prepare attendees to create their own data ingestion scripts, the tutorial will walk through a set of examples for robust and responsible data collection and ingestion. This tutorial will conclude with a case study of Baleen, an automated RSS ingestion service designed to construct a production-grade text corpus for NLP research and machine learning applications. Exercises will be presented both as Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts.",

    "short-abstract": "Optimization can often help to make Python programs faster or use less memory. Developing a strategy, establishing solid measuring and visualization techniques as well as knowing about algorithmic basics and datastructures are the foundation for a successful optimization. The tutorial will cover these topics. Examples will give you a hands-on experience on how to approach efficiently. Python is a great language. But it can be slow compared to other languages for certain types of tasks. If applied appropriately, optimization may reduce program runtime or memory consumption considerably. But this often comes at a price. Optimization can be time consuming and the optimized program may be more complicated. This, in turn, means more maintenance effort. How do you find out if it is worthwhile to optimize your program? Where should you start? This tutorial will help you to answer these questions. You will learn how to find an optimization strategy based on quantitative and objective criteria. You will experience that one's gut feeling what to optimize is often wrong. The solution to this problem is: „Measure, Measure, and Measure!“. You will learn how to measure program run times as well as profile CPU and memory. There are great tools available. You will learn how to use some of them. Measuring is not easy because, by definition, as soon as you start to measure, you influence your system. Keeping this impact as small as possible is important. Therefore, we will cover different measuring techniques. Furthermore, we will look at algorithmic improvements. You will see that the right data structure for the job can make a big difference. Finally, you will learn about different caching techniques. ",

This tutorial will teach you how to leverage to power of C in your Python projects. We will start by explaining the C representation of Python objects and how to manipulate them from within C. We will then move on to implementing functions in C for use in Python. We will discuss reference counting and correct exception handling. We will also talk about how to package and build your new extension module so that it may be shared on PyPI. (We will only be covering building extension modules on GNU/Linux and OSX, not Windows). After the break, we will show how to implement a new type in C. This will cover how to hook into various protocols and properly support cyclic garbage collection. We will also discuss techniques for debugging C extension modules with gdb using the CPython gdb extension.",

Unlike many introductory statistics courses, we will not be applying 'cookbook' methods that are easy to teach, but often inapplicable; instead, we will learn some foundational statistical methods that can be applied generally to a wide variety of problems: maximum likelihood, bootstrapping, linear regression, and other modern techniques. The tutorial will start with a short introduction on data manipulation and cleaning using pandas, before proceeding on to simple concepts like fitting data to statistical distributions, and how to use Monte Carlo simulation for data analysis. Slightly more advanced topics include bootstrapping (for estimating uncertainty around estimates) and flexible linear regression methods using Bayesian methods. By using and modifying hand-coded implementations of these techniques, students will gain an understanding of how each method works. Students will come away with knowledge of how to deal with very practical statistical problems, such as how to deal with missing data, how to check a statistical model for appropriateness, and how to properly express the uncertainty in the quantities estimated by statistical methods.",

    "short-abstract": "There has been uprising of probabilistic programming and Bayesian statistics. These techniques are tremendously useful, because they help us to understand, to explain, and to predict data through building a model that accounts for the data and is capable of synthesizing it. This is called the generative approach to statistical pattern recognition. Estimating the parameters of Bayesian models has always been hard, impossibly hard actually in many cases for anyone but experts. However, recent advances in probabilistic programming have endowed us with tools to estimate models with a lot of parameters and for a lot of data. In this tutorial, we will discuss two of these tools, PyMC3 and Edward. These are black box tools, swiss army knifes for Bayesian modeling that do not require knowledge in calculus or numerical integration. This puts the power of Bayesian statistics into the hands of everyone, not only experts of the field. And, it's great that these are implemented in Python with its rich, beginner-friendly ecosystem. It means we can immediately start playing with it. We have planned three awesome parts, spread over three awesome hours: First hour: Introduction to Bayesian machine learning. Second hour: Baby steps in PyMC3 and Edward. Third hour: Solve a real-world problem with PyMC3 or Edward (model, fit, criticize).",

Teach students how to reason about parallel computing 2. Provide hands-on experience with a variety of different parallel computing frameworks. Students will walk away with both a high-level understanding of parallel problems and how to select and use an appropriate parallel computing framework for their problem. They will get hands-on experience using tools both on their personal laptop, and on a cluster environment that will be provided for them at the tutorial. For the first half we cover programming patterns for parallelism found across many tools, notably map, futures, and big-data collections. We investigate these common APIs by diving into a sequence of examples that require increasingly complex tools. We learn the benefits and costs of each API and the sorts of problems where each is appropriate. For the second half, we focus on the performance aspects of frameworks and give intuition on how to pick the right tool for the job. This includes common challenges in parallel analysis, such as communication costs, debugging parallel code, as well as deployment and setup strategies.",

However, these useful tools obscure the foundations of network programming upon which they are based, which can be very helpful to understand. So instead of building useful applications with these libraries, let's experiment with sockets! At this tutorial, a Python-flavored history of the web will be presented and attendees will write or modify a TCP chat client, a static site web server, an HTTP client, a CGI script, and a WSGI-compliant server and web application. We will learn what all those things are and how they fit together, bringing the architecture of modern web apps into better focus. The material will be accessible to participants with no web development experience, however, they must be able to write and run Python scripts at the command-line. This tutorial might appeal to someone also attending an introductory web development tutorial, but it covers separate, complementary material. Web development experience is not required but a little exposure would be helpful; for instance, installing flask and running the minimal application on the quickstart page. Similarly, prior exposure to HTML would be useful but is not necessary.",

    "short-abstract": "smtpd.py has been in the standard library for many years. It's been a common tool for deploying SMTP and LMTP servers that handle email-based communication in Python, providing both basic protocol implementations and a fundamental module for higher level tools, such as lazr.smtptest for testing email clients. Based on asyncore and asynchat, smtpd.py is showing its age, and its API is unwieldy. Fortunately, there's a new alternative available. aiosmtpd is a modern reinvention based on asyncio, with all the improvements that come along with such a new implementation. It provides servers for both the SMTP and LMTP protocols, as well as a higher level 'controller ' API for testing SMTP and LMTP clients. It exposes a much better API for customization, allowing the user to associate a simple 'handler ' to process incoming messages without having to worry about the details of the protocols, and it provides some useful hooks for subclassing. This talk will describe the purpose and history of smtpd.py and aiosmtpd, show how users can extend the servers and implement specialized handlers, and show how applications can use the testing API for ensuring that their email sending applications do the right things. Examples will be taken from GNU Mailman 3, which uses aiosmtpd extensively.",

The most interesting and challenging part is producing unique music without infringing the copyright. The generated music has to sound good, and what sounds good is very subjective and varies from culture to culture. Artificial Neural Network/Deep Learning has a wide range of applications, such as in Image processing, Natural language processing, Time series prediction, etc. But what about its usage in art? Could we use deep learning to create music? This talk is about how deep learning models were used to produce music - catering particularly to Bollywood. This talk would show how an exquisite piece of art i.e. music can be generated using deep learning model which helps in automated feature extraction. In order to automate the music generation, the model must be able to remember the learned features over the longer period of time, this is achieved by a special type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) called as LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) network. Implementation of such complex model can be made much easier using inbuilt Python libraries such as Keras with Theano as backend. It allows for easy and fast prototyping. Packages like numpy and scipy are being used for easier mathematical computation of input vectors and for reading/writing the WAV files respectively. The neural network architecture makes use of numerous amount of music samples to train the model. After an adequate number of iterations and training time, this model generates music that is unique and original. In this talk, steps involved in preprocessing of data, training the model, testing the model and generating the music from the trained model will be discussed. This talk will also cover some of the challenges and tradeoffs made for algorithmic music generation.",

    "short-abstract": "As the applications we build are increasingly driven by text, doing data ingestion, management, loading, and preprocessing in a robust, organized, parallel, and memory-safe way can get tricky. This talk walks through the highs (a custom billion-word corpus!), the lows (segfaults, 400 errors, pesky mp3s), and the new Python libraries we built to ingest and preprocess text for machine learning. While applications like Siri, Cortana, and Alexa may still seem like novelties, language-aware applications are rapidly becoming the new norm. Under the hood, these applications take in text data as input, parse it into composite parts, compute upon those composites, and then recombine them to deliver a meaningful and tailored end result. The best applications use language models trained on domain-specific corpora (collections of related documents containing natural language) that reduce ambiguity and prediction space to make results more intelligible. Here's the catch: these corpora are huge, generally consisting of at least hundreds of gigabytes of data inside of thousands of documents, and often more! In this talk, we'll see how working with text data is substantially different from working with numeric data, and show that ingesting a raw text corpus in a form that will support the construction of a data product is no trivial task. For instance, when dealing with a text corpus, you have to consider not only how the data comes in (e.g. respecting rate limits, terms of use, etc.), but also where to store the data and how to keep it organized. Because the data comes from the web, it's often unpredictable, containing not only text but audio files, ads, videos, and other kinds of web detritus. Since the datasets are large, you need to anticipate potential performance problems and ensure memory safety through streaming data loading and multiprocessing. Finally, in anticipation of the machine learning components, you have to establish a standardized method of transforming your raw ingested text into a corpus that's ready for computation and modeling. In this talk, we'll explore many of the challenges we experienced along the way and introduce two Python packages that make this work a bit easier: Baleen and Minke. Baleen is a package for ingesting formal natural language data from the discourse of professional and amateur writers, like bloggers and news outlets, in a categorized fashion. Minke extends Baleen with a library that performs parallel data loading, preprocessing, normalization, and keyphrase extraction to support machine learning on a large-scale custom corpus.",

    "short-abstract": "Python 3.6 was released in December of 2016 and it has a lot of new cool features. Some of them are quite easy for using: a developer can read, for example, about f-strings and they can start using them in their programs as soon as possible. But sometimes features are not so evident, and a new frame evaluation API is one of them. The new frame evaluation API was introduced to CPython in PEP 523 and it allows to specify a per-interpreter function pointer to handle the evaluation of frames. It might not be evident how to use this new feature in everyday life, but it’s quite easy to understand how to build a fast debugger based on it. In this talk we are going to explain how standard way of debugging in Python works and how a new frame evaluation API may be useful for creating the fast debugger. Also we will consider why such fast debugging was not possible in the previous versions of Python. If someone hasn’t made a final decision to move to Python 3.6 this talk will provide some new reasons to do it.",

A good, layered design using state machines can help avoid the tedious 'if' checks for flags, and ensure that if your code runs at all, it will run with all the required values initialized. I will demonstrate this with examples, and talk about some available tools and libraries to build state machines in Python. I will also discuss how to effectively use the process of threat modeling to build secure web applications. Threat modeling is a computer security technique that helps you better understand the systems you create, identify attacks, and build defenses.

    "short-abstract": "Assuming that you already know how to build a monolithic app, you must be wondering how you can use all this 'microservice' stuff that you keep hearing about. Well, a good word of advice is that you probably don't need it. If designed properly, a monolithic app should be able to scale and fit the needs of most businesses. Even so, you should keep your development as simple as possible until you have proven and solidified your business concepts. But if you do need to grow to Internet scale, then you have a long road ahead of you. Moving from a monolithic application to microservices is a natural evolution that is often of necessity. There are several competing schools of thought that are still being battle-tested in these early days of microservice architecture. Among all the competing paradigms, most of the requirements can be agreed upon, but are mostly differentiated by the tools used to fulfill the requirements. This talk will cover setting up the required infrastructure, and demonstrate how to migrate a sample monolithic Django application into a microservices platform. The demo application will use the following technologies: Django, Flask, Fabric, Terraform, Ansible, CentOS, Docker, Mesos, Consul, Nginx, Pgbouncer, Kafka",

    "short-abstract": "Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three.'Monty Python and the Holy Grail; Scene 33. Python 3 has been around for more than eight years, and much of the Python ecosystem is now available both on Python 2 and Python 3, often using a single code base. Nonetheless, this compatibility comes at a development cost and some library authors are considering ending support for Python 2 . These once-python-2-compatible libraries are at risk of being upgraded on non compatible system and cause user (and developer) frustration. While it may seem simple to cease support for Python 2, the challenge is not in ending support, but doing so in a way that does not wreak havoc for users who stay on Python 2. And that is not only a communications problem, but a technical one : up until recently, it was impossible to tag a release as Python 3 only; today it is possible. Like any maintainer of a widely used library, we want to ensure that users continue to use Python 2 continue to have functioning libraries, even after development proceeds in a way that does not support Python 2. One approach is to ensure easy installation of older versions if possible avoid incompatible versions altogether. Users should not need to manually pin maximal version dependencies across their development environments and projects if all they want is to use the latest versions of libraries that are compatible with their system. Even if we did expect that of users, consider what would happen when a package they rely on converts to be only Python 3 compatible. If they were not tracking the complete dependency tree, they might discover, on upgrade, that their projects no longer work. To avert this they would need to pin those at the last version compatible with Python 2. Users that want to use older python versions should not have to go through so much anguish to do so. In order to solve this problem, and thereby make both users' and maintainers' lives easier, we ventured into the rabbit-hole called Packaging. Though we set off with a singular quest, our tale roves through many lands. We'll narrate the story of our amending PEPs, our efforts in building the ramparts of the pypa/Warehouse Castle, battles with the dragons of Pip, and errands in the 'land of no unit tests 'otherwise known as PyPI legacy.By the end of the above tale,the audience members will know the road to Python 3 only libraries had once had hazards that are now easily avoidable.So long as users upgrade their package management tools.",

We split users into groups, show two or more variations of the site, measure how well each one does, and then show the best version to everyone. In this talk, I'll walk through a toy Python program that does the first step: splits users into groups. A few interesting problems arise: grouping users, whitelists, and scaling. I'll share different ways to address them. I'll also give examples of things that can go terribly wrong when designing experiment assignment code.",

    "short-abstract": "Recently, networking vendors and Silicon Valley giants have been putting forth a concerted effort to build standardized models for networking devices. These models allow for building reusable and versatile scripts with predictable, standardized data. Without such models, the wide variety of inputs and outputs required by different devices and vendors made scripting a tedious and challenging endeavor. The modeling language in use is called YANG, and a variety of standards have emerged. A vendor agnostic standard called OpenConfig has lately become stable enough to begin programming devices with it. Using Python, YANG is surprisingly easy to work with, and extremely powerful applications can be written with basic knowledge of JSON or XML and RPCs.The talk will start with use-cases for programming networking devices, and will detail a specific, trivial, use case that will be used in the talk. Next, we will discuss the ‘legacy’ way of programming devices (SSH and screenscraping), and highlight the challenges, such as complex regular expressions, slow responses, and lack of reusability between devices. From there we will dive into YANG, focusing on OpenConfig models. A YANG model is essentially a template, and JSON or XML can be mapped to the YANG template. This makes it perfect for Pythonic manipulation. In the use case there will be a GET RPC returning a YANG representation of the box’s state in JSON, which we will search for the relevant health indicator by drilling down in the JSON dictionary. A simple change to the dictionary will remediate the problem, and a PATCH RPC merges the new configuration onto the box. Since open, standard models are in use, this script could be run on many devices across a network to achieve the same effect with no changes needed. We will finish up with the pros and cons of YANG before opening the talk for Q&A.",

But when your factory automates complex non-linear workflows and is jam-packed with sensors and robots, you are quickly faced with software engineering challenges that call for modern tools. Python turns out to be surprisingly versatile in this setting, whether for prototyping a single conveyor belt or taming a building full of robots. This talk explains how to use Python for interfacing with two common industrial automation devices: a barcode scanner and a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). After a simple demo, you’ll hear about lessons learned using Python packages that weren’t written with robots in mind, like Celery and pandas, with robots.",

In addition, outputs from OCR or voice to text conversions tend to be messy or imperfect. Thus, we want to be able to make the most of our data by extrapolating as much information as possible.In this talk, we will explore the various approaches used in fuzzy string matching and demonstrate how they can be used as a feature in a model or a component in your python code. We will dive deep into the approaches of different algorithms such as Soundex, Trigram/n-gram search, and Levenshtein distances and what the best use cases are. We will also discuss situations where it’s important to take into account the meaning or intent of a word and demonstrate approaches for measuring semantic similarity using nltk and word2vec. Furthermore, we will demonstrate via live coding how to implement some of these fuzzy search algorithms using python and/or built-in fuzzy search functions within PostgreSQL.",

    "short-abstract": "Nearly everyone (especially in the Python community) agrees that good documentation is important to the success of software projects, and yet very few projects actually have good documentation. Often, it's not for want of effort - the project's developers have worked hard on it - nor for lack of documentation - the authors have produced a lot of it. It simply turns out to be not very good - not helpful enough for the users who should be able to rely on it, and a depressing chore for the authors who have to maintain it. The good news is that both these problems can be solved by understanding how documentation works, and what its different functions are. Structuring documentation according to those distinct functions helps ensure that each of them is adequately served. It also makes it far easier to write and maintain. Using real-life examples I'll draw out the key functions of documentation, and how they map onto different ways of writing it. Putting this into practice is simple when armed with some basic guidelines. The benefits are huge, and available with a minimum of effort. I won't be discussing documentation tools or software or other topics that have been covered amply elsewhere, but some neglected aspects of software documentation that will make your software projects more successful.",

    "short-abstract": "Over the last several years, Python developers interested in data science and analytics have acquired a variety of tools and libraries that aim to facilitate analytical processes. Libraries such as Pandas, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Yellowbrick have made tasks such as data wrangling, statistical modeling, machine learning, and data visualization much quicker and easier. They have accomplished this by automating and abstracting away some of the more tedious, repetitive processes involved with analyzing and modeling data. Over the next few years, we are sure to witness the introduction of new tools that are increasingly intelligent and have the ability to automate more complex analytical processes. However, as we begin using these tools (and developing new ones), we should strongly consider the level of automation that is most appropriate for each case. Some analytical processes are technically difficult to automate, and therefore require large degrees of human steering. Others are relatively easy to automate but perhaps should not be due to the unpredictability of results or outputs requiring a level of compassionate decision-making that machines simply don’t possess. Such processes would benefit greatly from the collaboration between automated machine tasks and uniquely human ones. After all, it is often systems that utilize a combination of both human and machine intelligence that achieve better results than either could on their own. In this talk, we will discuss human-machine collaboration as it applies to analyzing data with Python. We will review a framework for exploratory data analysis with the goal of identifying which tasks should be automated, which tasks should not, and which tasks would benefit from a more interactive, symbiotic, and collaborative process between the human and the machine. We will explore Python libraries that we can use to build tools that allow us to perform different types of analysis. We’ll also introduce the Cultivar project, an example of a hybrid analytics tool that combines a Django framework with Javascript visualizations and Celery for task management to facilitate more efficient and effective human-machine systems for data analysis.",

In this talk we will overview the main concepts about timestamps represented through datetime objects, the limitations on the standard library and some simple steps to try to avoid the common mistakes that everyone can fall into. Naive datetimes (which the datetime API works by default with) are a great tool to represent calendar times, but when talking about timestamps (focus of this talk) timezones is n essential part of it and the datetime module can be tricky to use for that use cases. We will also speak about different standards of time, time zones, Daylight Saving Times, leap seconds, serialization and datetime arithmetics.

Join me for an exploration of how to build data pipelines on Amazon Web Services Lambda with python. We'll cover a single introduction to event-driven programming. Then, we'll walk through building an example pipeline while discussing some of the frameworks and tools that can make building your pipeline easier. Finally, we'll discuss how to maintain observability on your pipeline to ensure proper performance and troubleshooting information.",

It's not surprising that there are a lot of 'X for humans ' libraries out there, some of which are mostly wrappers around more frustrating interfaces. This is not a theoretical talk. I'll touch upon theory to give you context, but will then talk about what that means for you in practice so that you can write better libraries. I'll talk about why library UX matters, about abstraction as a general concept, about out what happens when you over/under abstract, and about some useful tips to help build friendly APIs. Meanwhile, I'll show some positive examples from libraries we know and love (flask, SQLAlchemy, Requests, etc). Once you recognize these effects in play, you'll be able to apply them to your own code and make life better for everyone!",

We will see results of the Python benchmark suite on Python 2.7, 3.5 and 3.6. The bytecode format and instructions to call functions were redesign to run bytecode faster. A new C calling convention, called 'fast call' , was introduced to avoid temporary tuple and dict. The way Python parses arguments was also optimized using a new internal cache. Operations on bytes and encodes like UTF-8 were optimized a lot thanks to a new API to create bytes objects. The API allows very efficient optimizations and reduces memory reallocations. Some parts of asyncio were rewritten in C to speedup code up to 25%. The PyMem_Malloc() function now also uses the fast pymalloc allocator also giving tiny speedup for free. Finally, we will see optimization projects for Python 3.7: use fast calls in more cases, speed up method calls, a cache on opcodes, a cache on global variables.",

    "short-abstract": "Let's Encrypt launhced on April 12th 2016, for the first time allowing anyone access to free SSL certificates that could be automatically fetched and renewed. The demand was massive, and so was the need for a client to fetch these certificates for all of those users. This client is called Certbot, and it's written entirely in Python. Unfortunately for the sanity of Certbot developers, these users of Let's Encrypt can't decide on a single operating system to use! This requires us to ship our software, and all of its dependencies, to a variety of systems all with different web servers, Python versions, package managers,and underlying packages. Learn how we got through this mess!",

    "short-abstract": "Exception handling in Python can sometimes feel like a Wild West. If you have a send_email function, and the caller inputs an invalid email address, should it: A) Return None or some other special return value, B) Let the underlying exception it might cause bubble up, C) Check via a regex and type checking and raise a ValueError immediately, or D) Make a custom EmailException subclass and raise that? What if there is a network error while the email was sending? Or what if the function calls a helper _format_email that returns an integer (clearly wrong!), or raises an TypeError itself? Should it crash the program or prompt a retry? This talk will introduce the concept of an exception, explain the built-in Python exception hierarchy and the utility of custom subclasses, demonstrate try/except/finally/else syntax, and then explore different design patterns for exception control flow and their tradeoffs using examples. It will also make comparisons to error handling philosophy in other languages, like Eiffel and Go.",

Learning to do this well is difficult, especially for those who are new to Python and might not know where to begin or what questions to ask. While there is no “right way” to set up a development environment or application, understanding the components involved and how they interact can empower you to customize your setup to best suit your needs. This talk will dive into what happens when setting up a database, the purpose and configuration of an isolated environment, how Python packages are installed, and finally, how each of these components interact with each other and the application itself; in particular, how an application's structure facilitates said interactions.",

    "short-abstract": "Bayesian statistics offers robust and flexible methods for data analysis that, because they are based on probability models, have the added benefit of being readily interpretable by non-statisticians. Until recently, however, the implementation of Bayesian models has been prohibitively complex for use by most analysts. But, the advent of probabilistic programming has served to abstract the complexity of Bayesian statistics, making such methods more broadly available. PyMC3 is a open-source Python module for probabilistic programming that implements several modern, computationally-intensive statistical algorithms for fitting Bayesian models, including Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and variational inference. PyMC3’s intuitive syntax is helpful for new users, and the reliance on Theano for much of the computational work has allowed developers to keep the code base simple, making it easy to extend the software to meet analytic needs. PyMC3 itself extends Python's powerful 'scientific stack' of development tools, which provide fast and efficient data structures, parallel processing, and interfaces for describing statistical models.",

In the end this is accomplished using a little algebra, a little geometry, and a healthy dose of Python. That is, I will present a case study of using Python in several aspects of a mathematical visualization project, from the computation itself, to transforming and converting data, and finally for scripting the process of generating the images. Along the way I'll explain how Python's convenient idioms and containers (e.g. sets and set comprehensions) are a good fit for some of the algebraic and geometric questions that come up, how Scipy and Numpy enable fast numerical calculations, and how Python's strength as a language for scripting and automation allows easy orchestration of rendering of still images and frames of animations. The mathematical visualization project we describe is a collaboration with François Guéritaud (Université de Lille).",

    "short-abstract": "Requests is widely acknowledged as a library that saves users an enormous amount of time, effort, and pain through its intuitive and clear API. For this reason, most people who have never looked at the code assume that its code is as intuitive, well-structured, and clear as the API. Of course, the truth is more complex than that. Real software that deals with real problems is rarely ideal: there are edge cases, terrible hacks, and awkward workarounds for problems. Often in the software industry we pretend that these imperfections in our software don’t exist, or we try to hide them. These imperfections frequently cause people to reinvent wheels in order to simplify the code, which has benefits for understandability but frequently has downsides for resilience. When people talk about “battle-tested” code, they mean code that has been dirtied up over time from its original Platonic ideal implementation to something that is just as complex and warty as real life. In this talk, one of the Requests and urllib3 core maintainers lays bare all of the worst and hackiest corners of the codebases of these two libraries. The goal is to help expose all of the invisible work done in mature codebases to tolerate edge cases and misbehaviour, as well as to try to remind us all that the perfect is the enemy of the good.",

    "short-abstract": "Companies with an artificial-intelligence plan have a differentiating strategy in the intelligence economy; however, implementing robust machine-learning in production is nontrivial, often requiring a close collaboration between data scientists and developers, and retooling the production stack and workflows to develop and maintain accurate models. Machine learning in production involves model application, handling missing data, data artifacts, and data outside of the training calibration. A rigorous evaluation framework draws upon logging to determine characteristics of model coverage, model performance, auditing, and run-time performance. Model coverage includes the number of times the model produced sensible output relative to number of times it is called. Model coverage is reduced if the model does not converge or model criteria are not met. Model performance is evaluated with a suite of metrics (accuracy, AUC, FPR, TPR, RMSE, MAPE, etc.), which assist in determining the most appropriate model to use in the production scenario and the validity of the model training. Regularly performing manual audits for spot checks is important for debugging and ensuring the model passes sanity checks. Model performance includes run times and profiling model pieces, ensuring performance is within specified requirements and refactoring otherwise. In the AI renaissance, where ML is a critical piece of intelligent products, seamlessly integrating model evaluation into workflows is an important component of making robust products and building a satisfying customer experience. Python is a great language to build intelligent products with its abundance of ML libraries and wrappers contributed as open-source software in addition to rich full-stack capabilities.",

    "short-abstract": "The statistician John Tukey -- who designed the box plot and coined the term 'bit' -- wrote: 'An approximate answer to the right problem is worth a good deal more than an exact answer to an approximate problem '. Python has become one of the major languages for statistical data analysis, not least because of the expressiveness of the language itself and the availability of tools like Jupyter Notebooks, which enable iterative reasoning about a problem and its solutions. This talks takes one step beyond an introduction to statistics with Python and aims to familiarize the audience with two concepts: a class of problems (so-called inverse problems), and a powerful statistical tool (the random walk, or more formally Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling with the Metropolis algorithm). In inverse problems, model parameters are estimated from observational data. Both model and data are expected to be affected by error. The objective is not only to find parameters that best describe the observations, but also to figure out how good, or how possibly bad, a solution might be. Inverse problems are extremely common in many fields and crop up each time we attempt to reconstruct a reality from sensor, radar, scattering or imaging data. The Metropololis-Hastings algorithm offers a solution via random sampling of a Bayesian posterior distribution. Even though listed as one of the 20th century's top 10 algorithms by the journal Computing in Science & Engineering, the Metropolis algorithm is easy to understand and implement, and a fun and instructive way to explore even complicated multi-variate probability distributions.",

As a data scientist who has worked in the industry for several years, I have had a lot of experience dealing with messy, inaccurate, incomplete data, and I want to share those experiences with you. I'll talk my way through three real-world situations where I've had to analyze and build models on untidy and complex data, going through how I've preprocessed the data and prepared it for modeling.

We will discuss tools that exist in Python for using lazy evaluation and show how we can build on the primitives to better represent computations.

Wonder no more, this talk is for you. In 30 minutes I'm going to demonstrate real world text processing problems and how Python 3 helps solve them. The talk is going to explain how you should split your text from binary data in your application, what are sensible defaults and what are possible gotchas. All this sprinkled with a healthy dose of frustration by a guy whose first name starts with Ł.",

We'll briefly review the state of numerical computing in Python, look at some examples to help you remember why you should use NumPy based packages whenever possible, and focus on two options for acceleration: faster serial computing or parallelization. Continuum Analytics has developed two popular open source packages to address these issues: Numba, which provides an LLVM-based JIT that can be easily accessed just through a decorator; and Dask, which provides a distributed computing framework and some high quality data structures that are similar to a Pandas DataFrame or a NumPy NDarray.

    "short-abstract": "Tracing is a specialized form of logging that is designed to work effectively in large, distributed environments. When done right, tracing follows the path of a request across process and service boundaries. This provides a big step-up in application observability, and can help inform a developer why certain requests are slow, or why they might have behaved unexpectedly. This tutorial will familiarize users with the benefits of tracing, and describe a general toolkit for emitting traces from Python applications in a minimally intrusive way. We will walk through a simple example app, which receives an HTTP request, and gradually instrument it to be observable via traces. We will discuss language constructs that can generate traces - namely decorators, monkey-patching and context managers - and give users hints on how they might add tracing to their own applications and libraries. In the process users will become familiar with the existing standards for modelling traces, and some of the challenges involved in adhering to this model in a distributed, asynchronous environment.",

However, developing deep neural nets is an intricate procedure, and scaling that to big data scale is an even more challenging process. Therefore, deep learning tools and frameworks, especially visualization support, that can run smoothly on top of big data platforms are essential for scientists to understand, inspect and manipulate their big models and big data. In this talk, we will share how we bring deep learning to the fingertips of big data users and data scientists, by providing visualizations (through widely used frameworks such as Jupyter Notebooks and/or Tensorboard) as well as Python toolkits (e.g., Numpy, Scipy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Kesra, etc.) on top of BigDL, an open source distributed deep learning library for Apache Spark. In addition, we will also share how real-world big data users and data scientists use these tools to build AI-powered big data analytics applications.",

    "short-abstract": "This will be a hands on workshop where you will get to experience yourself how easy it is to deploy a Python web application to OpenShift. The latest version of OpenShift is implemented on top of Kubernetes for container orchestration and Docker for the container runtime. On top of these tools OpenShift adds its own special magic sauce to even further simplify the deployment of applications. In the workshop you will learn how to deploy a Python web application direct from a Git repository holding the application source code, with the build process being handled by the Source-to-Image (S2I) tool. Next you will deploy a database from a pre-existing Docker-formatted container image and learn how to hook your Python web application up to it. Finally you will configure a Git repository webhook to automate the deployment process so that every time you commit and push up changes your application will be automatically rebuilt and deployed. During the workshop we will be throwing in various other tidbits to help explain what OpenShift is, how it works and how it can help you to host not only your Python web site, but also more complex applications, be they legacy systems, or new micro service architecture applications, in any language. For the workshop, you will be provided access to an online instance of OpenShift Origin with everything you need. The only piece of software you will need to install locally on your own computer will be a single program binary for our command line client for OpenShift.",

The Summit is a gathering of teachers and educators focused on bringing coding literacy, through Python, to as broad a group of audiences as possible. We invite educators from all venues to consider joining the discussion, share insights, learn new techniques and tools and generally share their passion for education. We are looking for educators from many venues: authors; schools, colleges, universities; community-based workshops; online programs; and government. Not only will we have a wide array of full-blown talks, we will also have a round of lightning talks!",
