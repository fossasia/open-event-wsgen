As part of a pilot project I took a five-day introductory Python/Django course in April 2009 to enable me to communicate better with our developers.

By day three of the course I realised that building the system I had envisaged was actually something I could do myself - so I did. I work at Divio (Zürich, Switzerland) and I'm a member of the Django Project core development team.",
