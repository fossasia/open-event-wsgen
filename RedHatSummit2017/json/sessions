We'll also discuss how container technology needs to integrate with existing systems, such as enterprise security and identity access management (IAM), monitoring and alerting, and how it can significantly increase enterprise deployment cycles through deployment pipeline automation and integration."

What every team wants when hitting their project's release button is a stable release that's been tested for all possible permutations and that doesn't break their setup. Enter: Distributed Continuous Integration (DCI). The more users, partners, and customers there are, the more configurations are tested, and the stronger the product stability gets.  In this session, you'll learn about the elements of DCI, and how it's been used to provide feedback for a project as complex as OpenStack. We'll also look at how partners and customers are using DCI for completely different architectures and deployment use cases."

With complex event processing (CEP), organizations can recognize, understand, and react to business events faster by processing large volumes of inbound data.

Critical CEP workloads require solutions that tolerate the failure of one or more processing nodes, while easily scaling to handle growing data volumes. They must process a high volume, velocity, and variety of inbound data, infer the context, and take appropriate action in real time while adhering to stringent availability and scalability service level agreements. In this lab, you'll implement a simple rule-based, event-based application on a cluster of distributed nodes. You'll see your events and rules scale up and down thanks to HACEP, which is the combination of Red Hat JBoss BRMS superpowered with Red Hat JBoss Data Grid."

In this lab, we'll answer all these questions and more. If you want a deep technical understanding of containers, this is the lab for you. Red Hat engineers will walk you through the deep, dark internals of the container host and what2019s packaged in the container image.

Ceph Rados Gateway has a 99.9% API compliance with Amazon S3, and it can communicate with the Swift API. In this lab, you'll tackle the REST object API use case, and to get the most of your Ceph cluster, you'll learn how to use Red Hat OpenStack Platform director to deploy Red Hat OpenStack Platform with dedicated Rados Gateways nodes."

Once you install Red Hat OpenShift, you'll learn how to diagnose, troubleshoot, and resolve common platform issues. Managing the platform doesn't stop once the installation is complete. You'll use Ansible to simplify ongoing maintenance and to make worry-free platform upgrades, all facilitated in an automated fashion. Finally, the use of centralized management systems will be introduced into the environment in order to demonstrate its importance and to provide a streamlined experience for both platform maintainers and users."

Using hands-on exercises, we'll walk you through a variety of applications and uses cases for OpenShift. How about seeing how easy it can be to deploy your pre-built containers? And how health checks to OpenShift can heal your application? We'll dig in to build containers just using a git repository. Want to see easy application scaling? No problem. Wish you could do A/B deployment? Your wish is our command. And finally, we'll show you a complete microservice application with database and polyglot back-end services. You bring your curiosity and willingness to code, and we'll teach you all you need to go home and start building pure awesomeness on OpenShift."

Their power efficiency and performance advantages are numerous, but FPGAs have traditionally required extreme levels of technical knowledge to use. This is changing, thanks to industry standardization efforts. In this session, attendees will learn about FPGAs00a0and how they can be managed at scale using emerging efforts within the larger open source community, including OpenStack and Kubernetes orchestration.Modernizing your HPC applications to take full advantage of the open hybrid cloudSteven Carter, Red HatAdopting cloud technologies and principles in00a0the development and deployment of HPC applications can yield substantial benefits in portability and scientific throughput. This session covers the impediments to running existing HPC applications in the cloud and details how to avoid them. 00a0Dynamic API back-end selection based on real-time health checks00a0through 3Scale API management and OpenShiftTom Corcoran, Red HatVeer Muchandi, Red HatRed Hat OpenShift is a game-changing containerization platform that runs your application workloads as containers at scale. 3Scale by Red Hat is an API gateway solution. While applications APIs can be managed centrally by 3Scale, occasionally an API back-end application may become unavailable. We will demonstrate the implementation of a circuit breaker pattern using a polling mechanism into the 3scale configured API gateway solution running on OpenShift. We will show how to configure the API gateway with primary, secondary, and even tertiary back-end servers to handle any given 3Scale configured API request. The polling mechanism is configured to test the health of each primary (and, if necessary, secondary and tertiary) back end00a0every X miliseconds. This results in a recently proven-to-be-available back end serving each request. It improves application reliability and availability,00a0as well as latency, as there are order-of-magnitude fewer waits for API timeouts.Fast as lightning : NVMe and NVDIMM's Impact on your data centerTom Coughlan, Red HatThe future of storage is memory, and the future of memory is storage. The increasing availability of00a0nonvolatile memory express (NVMe)00a0devices for use across fabric infrastructures and the growth of persistent nonvolatile dual inline memory module (NVDIMM)00a0memory is rapidly changing datacenter architecture.

The REST DSL removes the dependency that xcfrs has on CXF. Support for this new component reduces complexity while increasing the speed of development. In this session, we'll lay out the simplicity and elegance with which Camel REST DSL facilitates rapid development of microservices and addresses complex integration needs.Data protection with Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization, Red Hat JBoss Fuse, Red Hat JBoss BRMS, and Red Hat StorageLucy Kerner, Red HatCan you identify where all of your data is, where it all came from, how it is transported, what application has access to each data set, and what each application does with that data? Are you protecting your data with uniform access control? How do you respond to changing compliance requirements, starting with analyzing the inventory of data stores, access, and application usage? And finally, can you recover from discovering incorrect or inappropriate access, by quickly applying new access control policies or changing what applications do with that data? In this session, learn how a combination of JBoss Data Virtualization, JBoss Fuse, JBoss BRMS, and Red Hat Storage can help you with data protection and help answer these questions.HA deployments with JBoss FuseJosh Reagan, Red HatHigh-availability is a common requirement for applications in the enterprise. So how would you make Red Hat JBoss Fuse highly-available? It all depends on the protocol that you're using. Since JBoss00a0Fuse is an integration framework, it speaks many.

      "long-abstract": "Easily secure your mobile solutions with RHMAP and Red Hat SSOPresenters:Sebastien Blanc, Red HatSummers Pittman, Red HatAs a mobile developer, when you deal with security, you often have to dive into the details of bloated security specifications and APIs to solve issues like Single Sign Out (SSO), social login, OAuth2 and OpenID Connect integration. You want to be able to focus more on your core business, and for that purpose you use Red Hat Mobile Application Platform (RHMAP) on OpenShift. This presentation talks about various security issues your mobile applications and RESTful microservices will need to solve. On client side, we'll see the challenges to overcome from an hybrid app as well as a native app perspective: embedded web view versus external browser, URL schema for callback, local storage for tokens, refresh access tokens transparently...What about if you could delegate security intricacy to security expert? Security can be easy if you have the right tools! This is exactly what Red Hat Single Sign-On (SSO) on OpenShift is for. RH-SSO is an open source Identity and Access Management solution that can secure your applications and services with little to no code. If you think security topic is hard to tackle, join us! We'll make OAuth2 framework, OpenID Connect protocol, JWT (Json Web Token), and even encryption easy to understand. With some drawings, chatting and demos, tokens are fun and OpenID Connect will have no secret to you!00a0------------------RHMAP MBaaS Services and RESTful APIs (MongoDB and MySQL)Presenters:Chad Darby, Red HatHong Hua, Red HatIn this talk, we will demonstrate how to create an RHMAP MBaaS service that exposes a RESTful API for CRUDL. The first version of the MBaaS service will store data in a MongoDB database hosted on the RHMAP platform. In the second version of the app, we'll connect to an external MySQL database hosted in the Amazon cloud. During the development of the MBaaS service, we will test the RESTful API using a Postman test harness.------------------Artificial Intelligence Tools For Mobile DevelopmentPresenter:Juana Nakfour, Red HatArtificial Intelligence is a broad set of technologies getting immense traction and accelerated adoption rate on mobile devices. Predictive Analysis, Object Detection and Natural Language processing are the leading AI technologies making their way down to mobile devices and immersing in user experiences. Today, it is imperative that mobile apps have some element of AI to provide superior and seamless user experience.In this presentation, we will describe the current trends in AI tools for mobile devices. Specifically discussing the current big players in the field and their tools offerings. We will also cover trends in small startups pushing for innovative AI tools on mobile devices. The current trend of moving some AI processing from big clouds down to mobile chipsets for local processing will also be covered. After covering the high level trends we will dive down into current tools and sdk2019s available for native and hybrid mobile applications. Specifically in the areas of Natural Language processing and Object Detection/Tracking. At the end of the presentation we will describe how to integrate one of the Natural Language processing sdk2019s into our Red Hat Mobile Application templates. Describe the code steps and perform a live demo."

But one key element - the database tier - has remained stubbornly difficult to modernize. Often, as organizations move toward container and cloud-based environments, they end up leaving their database, their SQL skillsets, expectations of transactional consistency, and sometimes even their precious data behind. To address this problem, a new class of database - the elastic SQL database - has emerged. These solutions combine the ACID guarantees and SQL interface on which applications rely, while also allowing dynamic capacity management, continuous availability, multi-datacenter operation, and radical operational simplicity. Join us to learn what makes an elastic SQL database an ideal solution for modern hybrid cloud applications. We'll demonstrate how you can take advantage of this technology to optimize your application for fast transactional responsiveness, continuous availability, and full-active database utilization, even across multiple clouds, data centers, or hybrid environments.Ariff Kassam, Vice president of Product, NuoDBChristina Wong, Director of Product Marketing, NuoDB"

But, it can also mean the adoption of the open source software development model embodying collaboration, transparency and meritocracy, sometimes known as inner source. Furthermore, organizations calling themselves Open Source First typically will be active community contributors and even open source their own software. This session will look at real world scenarios of why companies are becoming open source first, what exactly does it mean, what are the actual benefits of this approach and the implementation and operational challenges.Andrew Aitken, General manager &amp; global open source practice leader, Wipro Lim"

NVMe over Fabrics, utilizes ultra-low latency RDMA technology to achieve data sharing across a network without sacrificing the local performance characteristics of NVMe SSDs.

As data persistence is a critical part of most IT services, Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) has become a desirable way to simplify and standardize database systems for easier management and rapid service provisioning. Red Hat OpenShift can solve this problem as an abstraction layer for deploying massive databases in multiple datacenters, potentially owned by different cloud providers and using different Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) solutions.

Eliminating a discrete storage tier emerges as a core benefit, considerably reducing footprint and many extraneous storage management headaches.

The target solution processes data on arrival and allows changing business logic on the fly. Data processing must scale up and down while integrating with all necessary internal and external systems. In this session, we present the operating prototype of our target architecture, which runs jBPM and FUSE on top of JDG 2014 and achieved almost linear scalability. You will learn how to implement jBPM on JDG in order to achieve massive parallel in-memory processing, leveraging FUSE to support flexible integration with any type of system."

It has the potential to increase competitiveness, innovation and efficiency, creating real benefits for both consumers and firms, you may have heard people referring to \"Fintech\" as an umbrella term for this disruption in Financial Technology. However, new technology also has the potential to increase the risk to a bank if not adopted without the appropriate controls, in fact there are a number of organisations such as the UK Finanical Conduct Authority and the US Federal Reserve who protect consumers and markets from this via regulations. In this talk by Bill Dettelback from Deutsche Bank supported by Chris Milsted from Redhat, we will explore various architectural aspects of a large OpenShift deployment into the regulated banking industry which were necessary to meet these standards. This included things like separate OpenShift clusters, Software Defined Lifecycles and Image Promotion between environments are just some example of some of the challenges faced. By attending this talk you will find out about how OpenShift can be deployed into regulated industries such as financial services and will see how we solved some of the challenges faced along the way."

In this session, see how we used a fully dynamic, rules-based web application to quickly create and publish a native, secure mobile survey application. We'll show how straightforward rules can create complex but secure interactions in the app, and how processes in JBoss BPM Suite can provide some order. We2019ll demonstrate how to manage application programming interface (API) communication between devices and these JBoss products using Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform and single sign-on (SSO) to authenticate, authorize, and report on API calls based on preconfigured policies, as well as how 3Scale Analytics shows a wealth of information across selectable time periods."

It takes the JVM to new levels of performance, yet has a small API. It lets you build scalable, microservice-based applications transparently distributed and packaged as a single jar file. This simplicity makes deploying and managing Vert.x applications on OpenShift a breeze. Upload your jar and Vert.x connects all your pods and services. That's not all, the application you're developing with Vert.x is \"reactive\": It's responsive, elastic, resilient, uses asynchronous message-passing saving resources, and handles a huge level of concurrency. How does that work on OpenShift?In this session, you'll see how the combination of Vert.x and OpenShift paves a new way to build and manage reactive systems. You'll see several examples and a demonstration of how Vert.x simplifies not only development, but thanks to OpenShift, the deployment and management of your distributed system. Everything you need will be covered in this session: service discovery, resilience pattern, rolling updates, monitoring, and metrics. This is a \"slide-less\" session consisting of pure, live coding."

This significantly simplifies both writing new CUDA programs00a0and porting older C/C++ (or even Fortran) programs to use GPU acceleration. In other words, malloc(3) can be called to allocate a buffer on the CPU, and that buffer's address can be passed to a CUDA kernel that runs on the GPU. HMM migrates the pages automatically.

Outdated scripts and error prone manual processes slow the onboarding process and waste time and money while also giving the new employee a poor first impression of the company. As enterprises evolve over time and attempt to meet ever-increasing demands, these growing pains are all too common. How does Red Hat manage its growth, along with 100+ new new hires each month? Join us to learn how Red Hat IT is leveraging the power of JBoss BPM Suite to propel Red Hat into the future as it strives to meet hiring goals and introduces productive new hires into the company. In this session, we will explore the real life case study of how Red Hat leverages JBoss BPM Suite to streamline 10 years worth of legacy ad-hoc human resource systems, by using a flexible and extensible process-oriented framework to better automate, optimize, and manage requests for access to company tools and resources. Attendees will hear some of Red Hat2019s 201clessons learned201d along with insights into best practices when leveraging BPM in their enterprise. Our team will also share historical metrics that are part of the Red Hat IT new hire processes. Outline: * Common onboarding issues and frustrations * What role can JBoss BPM Suite play? * Practical approaches to large scale integrations *Defining the boundary between process and implementation * Keeping the lights on - resilient infrastructure * Smart approaches to integrating with external systems * Playing nice with other workflow management tools *Keeping track of your processes * BPM - a developer's perspective * Code management * Deployment strategies * Working with the product engineers * Who benefits?

Microservice architectures are00a0by their nature an integration problem, where you have many decoupled services that need to work together. Red Hat JBoss Fuse, based on the popular Apache Camel integration library, was developed to ease integration of disparate computing systems by implementing well-tested enterprise integration patterns (EIPs) and supplying a developer-friendly interface with which to write the integration code.In this session, you'll00a0learn how JBoss Fuse integration services can smoothly transition you from traditional integration to modern containerized and microservice practices. We'll explore how JBoss Fuse is used to integrate microservices. We'll also look at how common microservice patterns can be implemented using Fuse EIPs, such as lightweight API gateways, circuit breaking, call chaining, service aggregation, and messaging. Don't re-invent the wheel when it comes to integration."

Today that cluster is at almost 7PB, and services a wide variety of research workloads from well over 1000 users across Monash's research intensive Clayton precinct. Prior to this large deployment we cut our teeth on Ceph on its home-turf - as block storage for OpenStack Cinder within Monash2019s node of the Nectar Research Cloud (a federation of distributed OpenStack cells) - that was in 2013 and since then we2019ve seen Ceph2019s popularity and community grow, with the first APAC Ceph Day hosted at Monash in late 2015. At Monash Red Hat Ceph Storage replaces legacy SAN storage for research computing, servicing use-cases from desktop CIFS file-shares to instrument data-capture and management, via HPC cluster home-directories and software libraries. The wide-variety of use-cases in the research space are what attracted us to Ceph in the first place - a storage unicorn that could service block, object and file workloads was a bandwagon we wanted to be on! Furthermore, the inherent difficulty in predicting the capacity and performance needs meant that a software-defined approach with no vendor lock-in was a key requirement for controlling costs and ensuring virtually unlimited scalability. In this talk we'll cover the high-level business and strategic challenges that led us to this solution and discuss how with first Inktank, then Red Hat2019s support we have tackled the challenges of architecting, deploying, and operating a cluster of this size (spoiler: it isn't that hard). We'll dive into some of the issues and pitfalls we've faced along the way and talk about some of the key use-cases and scientific data workflows that this infrastructure supports, for example, data capture, management and sharing from various microscopes across several facilities and platforms. To wrap up we'll look at our current progress in rolling out CephFS for production use-cases and detail how we managed to keep the whole thing in-service whilst it was physically moved to a new data-centre - this relocation is being planned now and will be complete by the time of the summit, so come along to find out whether there was a happy ending!"

      "long-abstract": "Aligning business requirements and IT can be a huge challenge, but it's key to any process improvement initiative.  Signavio's intuitive BPM and Rules modeling tools engage business analysts in the creation and sharing of excellent, executable process and decision models. Once these high-quality models are built, Signavio's integration with the Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite takes center stage. Signavio software uses Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) + Decision Model and Notation (DMN), allowing models to be seamlessly interchanged between the modeling platform and JBoss execution environment. This makes collaboration between analysts and developers far easier than ever before.In this session, we will examine the integration between Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite and Signavio Process Editor in detail, showing a hypothetical process for evaluating a credit card application and determining on-boarding for any new customers. This includes checking out the decision model in DMN and related process models in BPMN, as well as an export to the JBoss BPM Suite for the models' execution. From process design to seamless execution, you'll see why Signavio and Red Hat are the perfect combination for all your business process needs."

Amadeus C++ and Java application servers handle several million transactions per second. Knowing that each transaction performs several business rules evaluations, it is crucial that the rule engine framework is as efficient as possible with respect to the latency, CPU consumption, memory footprint, and scalability. As a middleware team, our responsibility is to offer the best possible rule engine solution that answers both our functional and non-functional requirements. We selected Red Hat BRMS/Drools and have worked on filling the gaps to make it fit Amadeus architecture, performance and operability needs; the key challenges being: integration in Amadeus C++ stack, under-millisecond response time, 0-outage rule updates.

Sky operates on different broadcasting platforms with different business models. The channels of the pay platform are available via satellite and IPTV. Thanks to NOW TV, a wide selection of the platform2019s content is available in streaming on one2019s home TV, in addition to the main Internet-connected devices, by simply connecting the NOW TV tv Box to the Internet. Sky is also on the FTA DTT with three channels: TV8, Cielo, SkyTG24. Sky Italia is strongly expanding his offer in the online streaming and on-demand offer where there are already more than 2 million connected customers that can use the on demand service with their DTH Set Top Boxes. In regards to On-demand, contents coming from broadcasting signal have to be transcoded for different devices: high performance, parallelism and high availability are the main challenges. In such scenario, Sky Italia used Openshift Container Platform, which revealed itself as a perfect fit for this project, satisfying all the mentioned requirements as well as adding up further values: environment isolation, rapid prototyping and testing, controlled rolling updates and parametrization. This talk will describe the final architecture that was laid out, and describe in detail some of the decisions taken and why those decisions were took. These include the deployment of Publish/Subscribe application, an hybrid cloud deployment model who take advantages of the latest available features in the platform, the creation of customized metrics, monitoring solution and some more.Also, this story shows how Gluster was used as base storage of persistent volumes in OpenShift, showing how converged systems bring additional value and demonstrating the integration of different technology stacks. Attendees will learn about:video-url Encoding use case delivered on top of Openshift.How the architecture was designed and built using Openshift and Gluster.Main challenges faced during the project and how we addressed them.Future plans for hybrid model with Public Cloud elastic scalability."

In this session, we2019ll discuss Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes, an application platform that runs legacy applications alongside greenfield polyglot microservices on Red Hat OpenShift, helping enterprises embrace microservices and cloud computing at their own pace. You'll learn the tradeoffs of microservices and monolithic architectures, as well as the costs and benefits of deconstructing a monolithic architecture. You'll also learn how legacy applications and greenfield applications written in Eclipse Vert.x, Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) and MicroProfile, and Spring Boot can take advantage of a common set of cloud platform services for application interoperability, security, and manageability. With this knowledge, you can build a cloud roadmap that is optimized for your enterprise."

An even harder question to answer is how to implement identity management compliance for OpenShift, but the question is really about bridging the gap between people who write compliance requirements, people who audit those requirements, and people who implement the technology.In this session, targeted to security specialists responsible for reviewing OpenShift deployments and those trying to build a compliant solution with OpenShift, I2019ll provide a map to help explain what compliance really means, how OpenShift is deployed, and how OpenShift technology is implemented to meet compliance requirements, including examples from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-53, NIST 800-63 and the Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS), mapped to a technology implementation. This map will help auditors better understand the compliance of identity management in OpenShift.The content for this session is based on my blog post: tremolosecurity.com/openshift-compliance-and-identity-managem"

However, IoT and its applications are often misunderstood and not considered with an end-to-end integration mindset. The challenges of IoT systems can be simplied with tools, processes, and methods already existing in DevOps. In this session, partners Accenture and Red Hat will explain how a solid platform and three-tier architecture using open source technology are key to building and benefiting from IoT systems. You2019ll gain an understanding of how IoT systems and DevOps are made compatible by adapting DevOps tools and processes and using a simple architecture to develop IoT applications, with examples of how partners are supporting digital transformation."
