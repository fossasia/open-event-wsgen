This talk will explain how to effectively review a site for accessibility and how to build accessibility considerations into your team process so each team member knows their role, and has the appropriate training material. The goal is for attendees to walk away with an actionable process which they can immediately use to assess and improve their products' accessibility and overall user experience.</p>",

Conversation is systematic, but to the surprise of many technologists, this conversational principle actually defies the rules of formal logic. So come find out the non-literal truth of everyday back-and-forths; take advantage of this principled, built-in 'hack' of spoken language; and delight your users with the intuitive ease of everyday conversation.</p>",

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offers five APIs that provide access to pre-trained machine learning models with a single API call: Google Cloud Vision API, Cloud Speech API, Cloud Natural Language API, Cloud Translation API and Cloud Video API. Using these APIs, you can focus on adding new features to your app rather than building and training your own custom models. In this session we'll share an overview of each API and dive into code with some live demos.</p>",

You can easily move the neural network model to Android and run the prediction inside mobile phones, to do many AI tricks things like image recognition, motion recognition and etc. But the challenges are the model size and CPU consumption. The models usually takes tens of megabytes, and also consumes CPU power for neural network prediction. In this session, we will discuss tips and tricks to overcome those challenges to bring the latest AI technology to production Android app.</p>",
