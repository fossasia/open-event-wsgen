The badges bore a circular set of LEDs which would flash in a pattern unique to that badge. Attendees with other badges customized their light patterns by finding badges with patterns they like and \"having sex\" with them. The description of the light patterns is based on a diploid genome, and the process of breeding lights is modeled after the biological process of having sex. The overall protocol to exchange light genomes was designed to require explicit consent of both parties, thus layering a social experiment on top of a hardware experiment. By requiring explicit consent, the badges also served as an icebreaker and a seed for many fun conversations.",

With regard to the notion of belonging and possession of material objects of other cultures, the artists intention is to make cultural objects publicly accessible and to promote a contemporary and critical approach on how the âGlobal Northâ deals with heritage and the representation of âthe Otherâ. âWe should tell stories of entanglement and Nefertiti is a great case to start with to tell stories from very different angles and to see how they intertwine.â   At this link you will find a torrent to access the dataset under a public domain:  <a href=\"http://nefertitihack.alloversky.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://nefertitihack.alloversky.com</a>   Here is the video showing the scanning process:  <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/148156899\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://vimeo.com/148156899</a>  âThe Other Nefertitiâ  is a conceptual art piece questioning singularity and originality as well as ownership of material objects of other cultures. Nora Al-Badri and Jan Nikolai Nelles  went to the Neues Museum and scanned the iconic bust, but of course nobody knows if even this is the original bust. Through time and restoration there might not much genuine be left of the artifact itself. We give meaning to objects as well as we give meaning to data. Why worshipping the original, while we have all that beautiful remixes as of today? Maybe it was a server hack, a copy scan, an inside job, the cleaner, a hoax, but who cares, first of all it is an art piece. Of course a scan of the same thing looks the same, doesn't it? And tomorrow everybody with cameras or smartphones or Xbox will have the means and technique, where one can reclaim the interpretational sovereignty through scanning and sharing.   What the artists strived to achieve is a vivid discussion about the notion of possession and belonging of history in our museums and our minds. A discussion on the originality and truth of data as well as material objects is necessary, because in the end one concludes, that the institutional practice of todays museums and collections all around the Western world are corrupted. Museums are telling fictional stories, their stories, just because they control the artifacts and the way of representation. The fetishization of sacred staged artifacts and the Disneyfication is producing capital value for illicit trading and looting artifacts. One can't find a reflection about violent entanglement of the museums and their inherent colonial patina themselves. But isn't representing âThe Otherâ always violent? Art is about building new narratives, deconstructing power relations, not scanning techniques... .",

The talks are usually given at conferences in order for the event to have many speakers discuss a multitude of topics. The conferences are held in order for individuals to be able to share their ideas and concepts to people who have experience in the specific field. Lightning talks are brief which requires the speaker to make his or her point clearly and rid the presentation of non-critical information. This causes the audience to be more attentive to the speaker and gain a broader array of knowledge from the presentations given.",

In this report Iâve documented my research on anomaly detection in cloud computing architectures like OpenStack, Microsoft Azure &amp; Amazon Web Services(AWS). Cloud computing systems create a big jungle of Logs and Metrics and these can provide a cloud operator tremendous insight into the systems and answer the most important questions about architectureâs health. My research shows that cloud computing architectures face completely different types of anomalies than discussed in other domains and these metrics are not very useful if used in single dimension but if we perform anomaly detection on multiple dimensions together and correlate thus generated insights with Logs we can increase our efficiency and decrease false positive cases by a huge margin. When dealing with this amount of logs and metrics we need to come up with novel distributed architectures. In this research Iâve focused on multiple dimensional anomaly detection on storm like distributed system using locality sensitive hashing and sequence mining. I hope that this research will provide us with a better understanding of different directions in which research and implementations have been done on the domain of anomaly detection, and how techniques which are proposed and implemented for a domain can be applied in different domains for which it was not initially intended to begin with.",

I will then put some light on the other two projects. Firstly, Ming Ngo added visualization of 3D-data to LabPlot using the powerful VTK library. This helped data to be visualized as  points in 3D-space, curves and surfaces. Another project by Ankit Wagarde, he added a very useful tool to LabPlot that allows users to extract data from images. After importing of an image and setting the reference points, the user starts to select the data points on the image that get automatically converted into numbers.",

    "long-abstract": "FarmMind Technologies ==================== 1        PROBLEM STATEMENT ---------------------------------------------- This smart centralized system will help farmers to take a step into precision agriculture being monitored by wireless sensors in and around their farms. This covers problems like irrigation management, crop maintenance, soil fertility maintenance, crop yield improvement, pesticide management in compliance with good agricultural practices.  2        WORK FLOW  ---------------------------- The innovation focuses on developing a smart centralized system to control different requirements for a farm per crop being grown. An IoT based system integrates the cloud AI services with that of the hardware and sensors in the farms / fields which constantly stream real-time information to the servers. Depending on various other parameters like humidity, temperature and other meteorological data, predictions of the requirements of the farm is calculated and the hardware device which automatically opens the valves for irrigation / warns the farmer about doing a scheduled check in the localized language is made via SMS. This provides a centralized GIS collection of the soil data allowing extensive research and work by the agricultural scientists to guide the farmers in a given area for the crop they're growing. Simultaneously it provides the data for governments to optimize on the water irrigation routes / canals so that other drought struck areas can ensure water in times of need. The hardware solution consists of various sensors connected to the GSM chip module on board which allows the farmers to irrigate the farms when needed or transmit data to the required scientists/soil experts in the area who could help.  â¢        It keeps updating the data base on parameters such as soil temperature, humidity, air temperature, determine frost and heat events, forecast harvest time. â¢        It maps the fields from phone using GPS and input field sampling information.  â¢        This systems aims for mobile first and cloud first implementation. â¢        It integrates pest management system by observing, inspecting, and identifying certain trends in the pests and pesticides. It keeps the track record. â¢        Last but not the least, it proposes high yielding plans and best crop management plans even under disasters.  3        FIELDS ARE THE NEW OFFICES AND DATA IS DRIVING THE TRACTORS  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We are trying to use the emerging Cloud based technologies in AI, machine learning and big data to solve important problems as well as to get the problem notified to the related person in real time. This system allows farmers to monitor and maintain the quality of their farms by sitting at their home just using simple services like SMS in case there is no internet connectivity present in the area or by using the app built for android phones. The hardware is also sending data of the farm to the agricultural scientists who can use it to make data driven decisions. Integrations with the other meteorological information helps to offer the best advice for irrigation. This system can also be used to inform the farmers in a particular area in case of an agricultural outbreak risk in that area. The other solutions include animal breeding and maintaining the data informing the farmers about the required medication needed for the cattle. Mainly focuses on reliable, safety, interoperable, low cost implementation.",

In developing countries like India where the internet is still expensive. This is exactly where our IoT platform steps in, with a mission to build a scalable and extensible real time tracking system.   We would be having a small IoT device installed in your vehicle which would able to transfer data back and forth to the server. It will help in tracking different vehicles in real time. It would be scalable to any possible vehicle runs on the road. For example, Truck owner would able to track his Trucks travelling in different part of the country, it will give him power to not only track his vehicles but also notifies him during vehicle accident. This technology is the future of the Shipping Industry, Land-Cargo Industry and also for personal use for tracking your vehicle or in the case of car-theft.",

Lots of NodeJS developer use it as their main web application framework. They have their own coding-style for the application route and also its middleware.   Now, imagine if there are several backend engineers, developing a big web application and they never write any code documentation, only in several function/method. If there's a new engineer join the development, he/she has been given tasks by their lead engineer to enhance several endpoints and they don't know the flow of the endpoint. Hence, it will consume more time for new engineer to read other engineers code.  That's why PipaJS come to the rescue. PipaJS is a module for ExpressJS which will help developers to understand the flow of each route by just reading the route and its middleware flow.",

This heats up the pressure on individual mobile developers to find ways to stand out from the crowd and generate revenues. While a great app is a good start, developers who wants to build a serious business also need a solid monetization strategy.",

It also allows to bundle the package for production, hence doing away with grunt, gulp or any other task runner. Under the hood it is powered by SystemJS to load the packages. Inside, it is nothing but a polyfill for the proposed ES2015 module loader, to make good use of the future javascript today. JSPM is going to be at the forefront of package/dependency management in the long run as hacks like minification and bundling soon become unnecessary in an attempt to make our web applications faster.",

Second, the intension and extension of SDMKD concept are presented. Third, three new techniques are proposed in this section, i.e. SDMKD-based image classification that integrates spatial inductive learning from GIS database and Bayesian classification, cloud model that integrates randomness and fuzziness, data field that radiate the energy of observed data to the universe discourse. Fourth, applicability and examples are studied on three cases. The first is remote sensing classification, the second is landslide-monitoring data mining, and the third is uncertain reasoning. Finally, the whole paper is concluded and discussed.",

But there are over 200 publicly available modules that have been developed to work on OpenMRS by over 500 different developers/organizations who maintain it without much coordination between themselves. There are modules that have moved between maintainers. Implementations of EHR systems have customized, release forks of modules in the true spirit of a bazaar model. There are over 25 projects that started in the OpenMRS community but have become their own companies, platforms, distributions that are used by implementers in over 50 countries. This fragmented community allows for freedom, but wastes resources, creates difficulties for new implementers and results in friction and dissatisfaction in the community. As central OpenMRS leadership, we have planned a certification process that will allow better management and governance of the community, but still improving the freedom of contributors to fork and establish smaller, specialized communities of practice.  The talk summarizes the historical divergence due to forks and communities of practice, by showing evolution of the community over last 10yrs. Later in the talk I discuss how the certification process brings visibility, coordination and accessibility to new members of the community.",

Pocock talks about what has changed since then and where things are going in this domain in the year ahead, especially with the emergence of WebRTC and the ubiquity of browsers that support it and the opportunities this has created for the world of web development and interaction with other open systems.  Can you imagine a world where phone communication works with all the benefits of email (but without spam)? Per-minute charges eliminated, flexibility for developers to customize the experience with standard scripting languages like Python or JavaScript and organizations of any size able to assert their identity and brand securely using SIP and XMPP addresses?  Is this a worthwhile vision? What do each of us - developers, sysadmins and end users - need to do to make it happen? What will be the alternative outcome - for both society in general and fans of free technology in particular - if we stand back and allow proprietary solutions to run rampant?  This session will survey some of the free software solutions that exist today and ways you can participate in their improvement and deployment to help realize this vision.",

This is supported to a certain degree by a lot of projects which do minimal testing upstream and rely on downstream consumers, vendors, or distros to do an additional set of testing after a release. But, there is no reason that an open project can not also do QA in the open as part of the community.   While the term QA will likely evoke a combination of fear, disdain, or any of a plethora of negative emotions from anyone who has worked in a traditional enterprise development environment and probably scare them off. The top down approach, strict bureaucracy, and other issues which are often synonymous with QA teams doesn't have to be the case. There can be real benefits to having a dedicated QA effort on an open source project. It enables transparency in how testing is done, lets anyone contribute and collaborate, and can signal to consumers the stability of a project. Larger projects can especially reap a lot of benefit from having people working on the QA side of a project upstream.  This talk will use OpenStack as an case study to explore how a large open source project can do QA in an open manner and the potential benefits it can provide. It'll cover how the OpenStack community does QA, how it's evolved over time, and share lessons of some best practices which have been learned over time.",

Wireless remotes can also control devices. Sensors can provide information about motion, sunset, temperature. Capturing caller id and auto-dialing is also covered. X10 is an ideal system for home automation, and there are methods to improve reliability. Computers can easily send X10 signals across your electrical network. The session concludes with a live demo showing a home with 38 computer-controlled devices and sensors.

PSL@FOSSASIA   aims to deliver low-cost lab equipments to millions of students and young scientists and enable them to learn science by experimenting and exploring.  The main components of PSL are  ExpEYES: Experiments for Young Engineers and Scientists [1] and MicroHope: Micro-controllers for Hobby Projects and Education [2] , projects by Dr. Ajith Kumar B P of IUAC, New Delhi [3].  ExpEYES is an Open Hardware and Free Software framework for developing science experiments, classroom demonstrations and projects without getting in to the details of electronics or computer programming. It converts your PC into a portable science laboratory.   In this workshop participants will be able to do hands-on science experiments  covering various concepts like electricity, electromagnetic induction, sound, interference, oscillations etc...  This workshop is for kids of any age [10 to 100 years :) ] who are interested in science hacks :)  [1] ExpEYES: <a href=\"http://www.expeyes.in\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.expeyes.in</a>  [2] MicroHope:  <a href=\"http://www.microhope.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.microhope.org</a> [3] IUAC:  <a href=\"http://iuac.res.in/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://iuac.res.in/</a> [4] PSL: <a href=\"http://fossasia.github.io/pslab.fossasia.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://fossasia.github.io/pslab.fossasia.org/</a>",

Using an Espresso Lite (that's no coffee - this is actually a little computer with wifi) we will turn some household goods and some wire into your own multiplayer game controller. You will learn a lot about electronics, networking, and how much fun it is to build an open source community when we explore some of the open source projects, who enabled me to build the software for these controllers. And of course, we will play at least one fun open source multiplayer game with our own controllers in the end of the class. I will also point you to many other open source game projects you can adapt to use your new customized game controller with the knowledge of this class.  Bring some basic computer literacy (no programming required but it helps to dig deeper), some curiosity, a laptop, team spirit, and the willingness to do some crafting (yes there will be scissors and glue).",

Our main aim of this project is to give the total guidance for the blind.Have you all ever thought of the problems faced by the blind people? No will be the answer unless otherwise you are a blind.Even we didn't realise the problems  before starting our project.First we started with  listing down the problems faced by the blind people and then started finding the solutions for it. So we came up with the following problems. 1. Difficulty in finding the obstructions on their path. 2. Difficulty in reading the road signs and traffic <a href=\"http://signals.So\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">signals.So</a> they can't either drive or walk safely on the road. 3. Difficulty in reading the price <a href=\"http://tag.So\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">tag.So</a> sellers can cheat them. 4. Difficulty in reading books.Since all the books are not translated to Braille letters.  5. Can't watch TV.   So we divided these problems into easy, advance and crazy to work on it.First we started working on the basic problems.The first solution we came up was using ultrasonic sensors to detect the obstructions.We created an app which is user friendly (blind person just have to tap) to give the voice <a href=\"http://output.So\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">output.So</a> we just fixed  3 ultra sonic sensors( per shoe front,back,left/right) and depending on the sensor output the voice will be given as output.Still we have problem in detecting in hanging obstructions and pits.We are trying to replace something with shoe which can fulfil all the conditions.Within a span of two weeks we have completed this task.Further we are working with image processing, machine learning and artificial intelligence to find the solutions for reading road signs(Image processing) and traffic signals(Colour recognition), reading books(Text to speech conversion) and finally for watching TV. As an engineer I suggest others also to work on the projects which would help the highly needed people. Because we never know the problems faced by the poor people and differently-able people. And they don't have enough knowledge or capability to work on their own problems.  ------------------------------------------   Problem Background: Corneal Blindness is one of the most common causes of blindness in India. India shoulders the largest burden of global blindness, about 3.5 million across the country with 30000 new cases being added each year. People who are visually impaired face no shortage of problems in India, where living with disabilities can be especially challenging. Pedestrians are often forced off of side walks that are cluttered with vendors, animals and other obstacles. And because of the difficulty of moving independently, accessing services is also difficult. Blind people typically use canes, of course, but the traditional cane can't detect objects higher than the waist.   Problem Statement: The problem is now to provide them with an alternative guide to the cane, a guide with a more human like approach.  Proposed Solution: Our proposed solution is to develop shoes starting from the most basic level to a highly advanced AI version of those shoes. The steps are as follows: â¦ Develop a model of shoes with 4 sensors for 4 different directions. These sensors can be distance or IR Led ones. A microcontroller interface would be in place to transmit voice messages through a communications module to the headset of the person wearing the shoes. â¦ In the intermediate stage the model would contain 4 cameras instead of sensors. The cameraâs working on basic image processing would be able to make out textures, landscapes and obstructions to a degree as defined by the manufacturer. â¦ The final stage would involve trying to get the shoes to define the situations it are placed in by themselves using image processing and machine learning.  End users: The blind people around the world. Since our final product doesn't make use of smart/mobile phone, the person who can use it need not be aware of it. The output will be given as sound through headsets. Devices: Shoes, 4 cameras, 4 sensors,  headset, a micro controller and other electronic components Platforms, Technologies to be used: Machine learning in Matlab using image processing, interfacing camera, sensor and headset Data set, tools, resources useful in developing solution: Can choose any image processing tools and other technologies.",

It will be insightful for start-ups to understand the the ecosystem and challenges when you manufacture at scale and the challenges to bring a product from a prototype to production stage.",

Repository can be found at: <a href=\"https://github.com/kres/zygote\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/kres/zygote</a> The idea was to make IoT development as simple as Lego, i.e. connecting blocks to build a system. In this case the system is made out of sensors, actuators and are connected to the cloud. The user visualizes all the sensor and actuator endpoints as simple building blocks on the browser. Interconnecting these blocks virtually on the browser creates a actual data flow in the real world (basically over the air configuration of all sensors and actuators). The user can then add triggers, events, timers, filters to the flow to create more complex IoT systems.  The top three highlights of the framework: * Setting up the IoT application can be completely visual. i.e. no programming required. (But code can be added if the user wants to) * The system can work over any wired/wireless medium - like bluetooth, WiFi, Zigbee, etc. * The framework is platform neutral. Though it is been developed on the Beaglebone Black, it will run fine on Raspberry Pi, Cubie board, etc. Not limited by the hardware.  During the proposed talk I will be talking about design and implementation of the project including the challenges we faced, sample application and future work. This work was presented at an International IEEE conference held in IIT Madras earlier this year.",

In oVirt 3.6 we introduce an integration with Katello to allow oVirt users to see available updates (ERRATA) on hosts and VMs that are managed by Foreman, and in addition on the oVirt engine machine itself. This gives oVirt users a wider view of the updates available for both the virtualized and infrastructure resources. The integration between the projects is still in progress and we plan add functionality to it for better management options for various entities in the data-center hardware - such as provision phase, package management, configurations control and upgrade flows.",

Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions. We can use it to build the infrastructure in many cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, Rackspace, DigitalOcean, GoogleCloud, Docker, OpenStack etc. Moreover it has an provisioners like chef, which we can use to automate for configuration Management. It can be seen as similar to cloud-formation from AWS. Within this short workshop with  this tool I am creating a basic two-tier  infrastructure stack in a single command. What I will do it in one stroke of command is Create a complete infrastructure in AWS VPC running an app server, What are the things happening in this one command:  - Creating a VPC. - Creating a subnets one public and private. - Creating respective security groups and rules. - Creating a load balancer. - Creating a app server running an web server called nginx. - Attaching a server to ELB and giving us a public DNS by which we can access the app. - And it gives a simple sketch diagram of our infrastructure as well. Thus we have full fledged app running on Cloud in single Command.

This puts lot of pressure on developers and then scalability, higher throughput, UI etc becomes their focus points.

For example while DBA team is concerned about consistency of data, developers are more often concerned about ease of development.   How do we address these challenges and work together. As a DB Architect for a solutions company I have been interacting with various customerâs development teams and getting to know their views on how they use databases. In the process, I have shared some inputs with them which they have found quite useful and in turn I have picked up a few tips from them.   During my presentation I would like to share about 7 such important lessons that should be pinned to every developerâs and data architectâs desk while developing a web-scale app. These tips are about improvement in the application design and architecture but they come from a Database Architectâs perspective. To illustrate these tips I would be using popular features of an open source database â PostgreSQL.",

    "long-abstract": "Jenkins easily allows you to build and test your projects continuously. But creating similar Jenkins jobs could be mundane sometimes, how about automating that part with Jenkins Job Builder by writing JJB configuration files for creating a number of Jenkins Jobs at once. One can keep job descriptions in human readable text format in a version control system to make changes and auditing easier. Creating a bunch of similarly configured jobs is also easy with templating. In this workshop, I 'll start with a brief introduction to Jenkins (if required) and Jenkins Job Builder. We shall do a hands-on session with writing JJB configuration files and see how the jobs are created in jenkins, how can we create multiple jobs and manage them.",

    "long-abstract": "Web services were divided in three parts: Scalable frontends, application servers, and infrastructure. No, four parts, for one indomitable component still held out against the recent trend of containerization: Datastores.  While setting up stateless web- and application servers is considered best practise today, creating ethemeral datastores is still tricky. The talk will show that ethemeral datastores aren't implicit contradictions and discuss how to implement this idea. The main problem is to deal with scale-out and scale-back situations. There are several ways to tackle that challenge, including, but not limited to to active-passive-clusters, read slaves, active-active-solutions ora couple of NoSQL solutions. Most of them are pretty complex to set up and operate, though.  Crate is an open source database that speaks SQL to the frontend, but scales horizontally by just adding more nodes. A demo shows how to set up a distributed application with a database cluster using Docker in less than 15 lines of orchestration code and compares it to other database clusters.  Software architects, web developers, and system engineers who have experienced the pains of scaling a database up to a big data level will learn in this session how to resolve the bottleneck of poorly performing data backends. It includes a working demo participants may download and extend.",

Let's stop fighting about whether we should implement the strictest interpretation of REST or how pragmatic REST-ful design is the only way to go, or debate about what REST is or what it should be.  A couple of demos (In Golang! Yay!) will be shown that are guaranteed to open up your eyes and see that the dawn of liberation for product developers is finally here.  Background: GraphQL is a data query language and runtime designed and used at Facebook to request and deliver data to mobile and web apps since 2012.  Hafiz Ismail (@sogko) is an active contributor to Go / Golang implementation of GraphQL server library (<a href=\"https://github.com/graphql-go/graphql\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/graphql-go/graphql</a>) and is looking to encourage fellow developers to join in the collaborative effort.",

For any given AMI &amp; authentication details, it can spin up the instance, and execute the tests on it.  Currently Fedora Project is using tunir to automatically test its own cloud, atomic, and Vagrant images. We write the test cases using Python 3 unittest module.

Learning science can be fun if we could visualize the concepts and relate them with the real world. Python programming language has the potential to change a dull teaching learning process in to more stimulating active learning. Equations in physics and maths always look dull and boring. With the power of python one can see the beauty behind those equations and can find real world connections. With the effective use of python programs a  teacher can actively engage the students and help them visualize the concepts and have better understanding. In this presentation I will talk about my teaching experiments with Python in Physics with live demo of some scientific python programs.",

    "long-abstract": "ircb1 is a IRC Bouncer as a service, made for humans. It's currently functional as a basic IRC bouncer, however, unlike mainstream IRC bouncers, it supports multiple client connections for the same IRC network connection for a user. It aims to provide a scalable bouncer service along with easy setup, deployment and management. It also envisions to provide a low barrier entry point for users, where users can join and start using the service in an automated fashion, without going through manual processes.  Although, ircb is a standalone product, it is also one of the core components of waartaa2. waartaa is our attempt to create an open source SAAS communication and collaboration tool, around IRC. We also participated in GSoC under the Fedora umbrella. However, we hit various roadblocks with the initial code base given to it's monolithic structure. So, we started breaking down the app into micro services. Thus, ircb, the scalable IRC bouncer to empower waartaa, was born.  IRC networks limit the number of connections for an IP, and this limit has to be manually negotiated, and the process takes time. We came to know of this during maintaining a demo instance of waartaa on a single node, when Freenode will stop rejecting IRC connections from our IP. That's why we are looking forward to have a multi node model for ircb, where we can intelligently distribute the IRC network connections, as needed. We are also brainstorming to figure out an intelligent way to load balance connections from IRC clients to the bouncer service in a stateless fashion. You can find some insight about it in our initial design docs3. We are also trying to develop a reactive store layer to empower realtime applications, in our case, waartaa.",

The library is built with a very specific goal - to answer the fundamental problem of Computer Vision - Object Recognition and Detection. We make available to everyone the existing solution in this direction in a common, intuitive and user-friendly APIs. Our simple and user-friendly APIs make this a great tool for Robotics Applications and robots and Computer Vision beginners and enthusiasts. And of course, the method dependent parameters to fine-tune detections to the limit, makes this a great tool for Computer Vision researchers and experts.",

I also mentored the extension's issues in Google Code In this year and had several students submitting their patches for the same, successfully closing number of the open issues.  I'll use the opportunity to explain and demonstrate this extension to the FOSSASIA attendees and talk about the step by step process involved in building an extension. This would particularly be useful for anyone aiming to work on and develop extensions to be used for any wiki-project (which are already quite popular these days).    Moreover, the extension still has scope for further development. In order to be able to contribute to the extension, it is important to understand how the extension works currently, so I would like to explain about this project and its code architecture and also discuss the possible features and their implementations during my talk. I also plan on giving a demo of my work on my laptop (if time allows) so that the audience gets a better idea about the project.",

OSM is the Free Wiki World Map â an openly licensed map of the world being created by volunteers using local knowledge, GPS tracks and donated sources.   One of the online tools developed by HOT to assist this effort is the Export Tool, which creates custom OSM downloads in a number of file formats for various regions around the world. The user can simply choose an area of geographic interest, select the OSM features they wish to export and specify a file format. This export can then be used on a variety of GIS tools such as ArcMap, QGIS, Google Earth, the OsmAnd mobile app and the Garmin GPS device.   The ability to easily obtain updated OSM data can greatly contribute to relief efforts on the ground, as well as being used for personal interests, business ventures and research purposes. In the case of the devastating earthquake that shook Nepal in April 2015, post-disaster road and building data from OSM was used to manoeuvre people and supplies to where they were most needed.",

The workshop will help participants install and setup the Loklak server on their systems.  Once setup is complete, there will be a hands-on tutorial on how to consume the Loklak API to build client apps on various devices and languages. This will cover an overview and short tutorial of using the API wrappers and a thorough walk-through of the API methods. There will be demos of apps made for web, mobile and IOT. By the end of the workshop, participants will be ready with their own app consuming the Loklak API on a device and language of their choice. We can then have a short presentation session by the participants showcasing the apps they built during the workshop.",

In this presentation, we will demonstrate an open source tool that can navigate code, recognize simple commands, and help you write Java, just by listening to your voice. Written in Java and built on open source libraries, you too can integrate speech recognition in an IDE or desktop application of your choice, by using a few simple recipes.",

    "long-abstract": "In recent years, the applicable enterprise area of PostgreSQL has been significantly enlarged by performance and functionality enhancement.  As a result, there is a emerging demand to migrate database systems to PostgreSQL from Oracle. In this presentation, we will report on the following two tools which greatly help our migration projects: * SQL Imcompatibility detection tool (db_syntax_diff) * Oracle emulating function libraries \"orafce\" and our enhancement   We are working at the open source software center (OSS center) at NTT which is the largest telecommunications company group in Japan. For the purpose of software cost reduction, we have been carried out a lot of database migration projects so far.   Most of our customers are preferring so called \"DB migration project\", in which only the middle-ware DBMS will be replaced and AP itself will be reused. This is because such projects are usually considered more effective in terms of development time and cost than the \"rebuild\" projects, in which the system will be build again from scratch.  Nevertheless, the differences between old and new DBMSs often block the migration projects technically, and considerable number of projects may be giving up eventually. We found the major factors that make the migration difficult is following two:   * Cost of the estimation work   * Technical difficulty of the estimation work itself   As a solution of these problems, we have developed a non-compatible SQL auto-detection tool named db_syntax_diff. This tool can extract PostgreSQL incompatible SQLs in AP for Oracle and append each of them a difficulty index for migration. We've performed more than 30 database migration projects using this tool.   As another effort to solve migration problems, we are also working on function enhancement of orafce (Oracle emulation libraries). Based on the knowledge of frequently seen incompatibilities in the above estimations, we have added a large number of new entries to the orafce.",

Traditionally, MySQL Replication supports a single master and many slaves, and it is either asynchronous or semi-synchronous. A new replication plugin for MySQL has been around for some time and this is named MySQL Group Replication. This plugin provides multi-master update everywhere capabilities, making it possible to update data, concurrently, on any server in a group. It provides additional synchronization between servers that makes them coordinate regarding transactions that are committed in the group.  This talk explains how MySQL Group Replication facilitates and improves High Availability and simplifies replication and application management - it will also include a demo.  Takeaways: - What's MySQL Group Replication and its evolution. - Understanding the architecture of MySQL Group Replication. - Demo on how to use MySQL Group replication for improved High   Availability.",

The primary objective of the session is to explore open source software benefits for public sector organisations, discuss the current state of adoption, and review the motivators and a-motivators affecting adoption. A secondary objective of the session is to investigate where organisations are utilising open source software and whether organisations consider open source software as a means of achieving business goals.",

As participants in global projects build upon each others ideas and inventions to be able to innovate in an iterative manner, a culture of co-opetition is emerging which allows companies to successfully collaborate and compete at the same time.   As part of this evolution from silo'd invention inside individual companies to collaborative project-based innovation, a parallel culture of patent non-aggression has developed through the creation of the Open Invention Network (OIN) which over the last 10 years has grown into the largest patent non-aggression community in the history of technology.     Keeping pace with the growth and proliferation of Linux and other OSS-based platforms into key markets such as mobile, home, auto and finance, OIN has doubled in size twice over the past 36 months and now is a community of over 2,000 entities and individuals explicitly committed to patent non-aggression in core technologies that enable innovation in these new markets/sectors.   The how and why of OIN's successful expansion and the benefits of participation in this free community will be discussed.",

When one can acquire different types of intellectual property rights at the same time for the different parts of the same property.  * Face of a patent (the metadata legal department cares a lot about) * Inventor, and inventorship * Can we destroy a patent? (Hint: talk to the owner) * Synopsis of the Patent * Title, abstract, and figures * The thick part (the body of the patent, or as we call it \"specification\") * The claims (Heart of the patent) * Indentation :) Unless and until a software patent is tested, in a court of law, by running of it, it is impossible to say if something matches with the claim of the patent or not. At the end of the talk we will go through various other resources which one can visit from where one can learn more.",

    "long-abstract": "As a student, we want to raise the awareness of using open source software online for free. The environment of using the open source software in Taiwan is monopolized by expensive software, such as Microsoft series, Adobe and Photoshop. People seldom get a chance to realize that they actually have easy access to resources online which is free and much more convenient. Moreover, most of the budget of our country is used to buy the copyrights of software packages, but in practice we only use the basic functions of them. Simply put, we waste a lot of money buying something which is unnecessary. We discover it is the language barrier that makes people in Taiwan less likely to use open source software programs. Getting the deeper understanding of the serious problem we faced with, we come up with some solutions. Using big data to analyze vocabularies which are used frequently, we gather the information to indicate language barriers. Moreover, we can list out all the words which is hard for people, so that engineers can use the software and check the vocabularies at the same time. By using methods to remember the vocabularies, engineers can easily use the software. We can even use big data to analyze the steps which are used frequently and visualize them as a report. Like, we make a brief introduction to summarize the basic functions. So people only need to recognize the steps and check it through the introduction when they need. We launch a workshop to teach them step by step in English how to use the open source software. By enhancing engineersâ English ability, now we can create a community to start influencing the general public. We create a community to overcome the language barrier and to change the habits of Taiwanese for using software. We start from NCKU and share with other schools. We create a platform for sharing the information of updated software. By translating the information from the internet like <a href=\"http://opensource.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">opensource.com</a>, we provide not only the materials for target group, but also chances to the general public to know the advantages of open source software.  On the other hand, we translate the video of âopensoucephysicsâ to use the materials in our education system. By using the interesting videos and materials, teachers can inspire students to think outside the box and use their imagination to understand some difficult science concepts in classes. Furthermore, we can integrate the education materials with âezgoâ and provide a chance for students to begin self-learning. We use three main methods to promote the use of open source software. First, we are going to launch a program which is composed of different schools such as NCKU, NCTU and NTU to create an engineering social media. Second, we cooperate with the professors and schools to open a course to invite students to join our translating program. Third, we create a social media and launch âhour of translateâ and invite friends to join us. Furthermore, we cooperate with the summer and winter camps to share our passion for open source software. To promote our ideas, we submit the application to teach for classes in other level of schools, such as elementary schools, junior schools and high schools.  It is necessary a waste that we seldom make the most of free resources online. We spend a lot of budget buying the software which is replaceable and deal with problems in an ineffective way. That is why we start this project to help others in an efficient way.",

However, when following best practises, the act of signing a key involves secure transfer of the OpenPGP key which contemporary casual key signing protocols for small groups address by exchanging the fingerprint of the key to be signed. The key will then be downloaded over an untrusted channel and the key obtained needs to be manually verified.  This presentation shows a novel approach to signing keys which makes it easy to sign a person's key. It enables very small groups of people to casually hold very small key signing parties. The key idea is to automatically authenticate the key material before the transfer via a secure audible or visual channel. A Free Software implementation of the protocol will be shown and people are invited to sign their keys :-)",

I will also be talking about the low-cost weather data-acquisition system developed and interfacing Gas sensors with ExpEYES. A Poster covering details of GSoC work will also be displayed at the venue.  In the end I will add little about my experience of GSoC journey with my mentors Mario Behling, Hong Phuc Dang and Andre Rebentisch, with some critical piece of knowledge or a new lesson to learn everydayâ¦..this may encourage and help future GsoC students.",

This workshop will introduce participants to the process of making PCB boards using a laser printer, transfer media paper and a heat press machine. Participants will get to make and assemble a working PCB board.",

We have added many new sensors plug-ins to measure a variety of parameters like temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, acceleration, tilt angle, magnetic field etc.  With this development we at FOSSASIA  are aiming to  provide low-cost, effective and open source laboratory equipment to students all over the world.  I will also be talking about the low-cost weather data-acquisition system developed and interfacing Gas sensors with ExpEYES. A Poster covering details of GSoC work will also be displayed at the venue.  In the end I will add little about my experience of GSoC journey with my mentors Mario Behling, Hong Phuc Dang and Andre Rebentisch, with some critical piece of knowledge or a new lesson to learn everydayâ¦..this may encourage and help future GsoC students.",

I will also be talking about the low-cost weather data-acquisition system developed and interfacing Gas sensors with ExpEYES. A Poster covering details of GSoC work will also be displayed at the venue.  In the end I will add little about my experience of GSoC journey with my mentors Mario Behling, Hong Phuc Dang and Andre Rebentisch, with some critical piece of knowledge or a new lesson to learn everydayâ¦..this may encourage and help future GsoC students.",

The systemd journal is systemd's logging infrastructure and hence a core component of pretty much all modern Linux systems.   Specifically, we'll play around with \"journalctl\" and related tools and what they can do for you. We'll particularly focus in filtering log output and structured logging, and everything else that makes the journal more powerful than \"cat /var/log/syslog\". Please bring your own laptop to this workshop. Please install a major distribution (Fedora, Ubuntu, â¦), that has adopted systemd (which is pretty much any, as long as it is somewhat recent). Some of the features we'll show rely on very new features of the systemd journal, hence the newer version you pick the better. But even if you don't want to bring your own laptop, it should still be useful to follow this workshop without any.",

We also did many things on the plumbing layer such as allowing GNOME to run Wayland.  The talk will introduce to some of the design philosophies inherent in GNOME 3 as well as the main changes brought to users and developers. Also, since GNOME 3.20 is another step of a long lasting incrementally improved user experience, the future of GNOME's development will be speculated on.",

The motivation behind \"reproducible\" builds is to allow verification that no flaws have been introduced during this compilation process by promising identical binary packages are always generated from a given source.  This prevents against the installation of backdoor-introducing malware on developers' machines - an attacker would need to simultaneously infect all developers attempting to reproduce the build.  Furthermore, a reproducible build has a wide variety technical advantages, including implicitly removing non-deterministic or unsafe behaviour (such as downloading third-party code from the internet), detecting corrupted build environments, reducing time-to-detection of a build host compromise, as well as numerous other debugging and testing advantages.  In this sense, reproducible builds are finally fulfilling the original promise of free software  - that you have actual control over what is being run on your computers.",

In comes generative art! Generative art is art created by an independent, non-human system, for example, art generated by algorithms. Remember screensavers from the 90s? Yeah, something along those lines. You'll learn how to create art in the browser with Processing.js. I'll demo the basics of animation and we'll explore how algorithmic and mathematical concepts such as recursion, tiling, and geometry can result in unexpectedly beautiful visuals.",

Ring is an evolved version of the SFLphone SIP client adding support for true peer-to-peer calling without any central server.  The peer-to-peer network transport is implemented using the OpenDHT library, making it a universal solution that can be used for any arbitrary real-time signalling requirement from any application.",

This peer-to-peer network is also accessible from other applications using the project's OpenDHT library.  Signaling protocols, like SIP, XMPP and IAX, typically rely on central servers to help users locate each other and initiate sessions. Ring is an evolved version of the SFLphone SIP client adding support for true peer-to-peer calling without any central server.  The peer-to-peer network transport is implemented using the OpenDHT library, making it a universal solution that can be used for any arbitrary real-time signalling requirement from any application.",

Ring is an evolved version of the SFLphone SIP client adding support for true peer-to-peer calling without any central server.
