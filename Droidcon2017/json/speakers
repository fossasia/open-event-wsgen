He founded Jana with a simple, yet powerful mission—to make the Internet free for the next billion. Nathan saw first-hand how affordable mobile data empowers users in these markets through his work teaching app development at the University of Nairobi, Kenya. It was there that Nathan and his students created an SMS system that became the technical infrastructure of Jana. Nathan realized that the sponsored-data model can both power smartphones and empower users. Nathan graduated from Stanford University with a B.S. in mechanical engineering and master’s degrees in management science and engineering and electrical engineering. His Ph.D. from the MIT Media Laboratory on Reality Mining was declared one of the “10 technologies most likely to change the way we live” by the MIT Technology Review.
