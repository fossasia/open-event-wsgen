Apps are for living your life: daily commutes, traveling abroad, handling your money, communicating with family, and much more! This places the responsibility of engineering top-notch software squarely in the laps of us developers. Unlike doctors, we were not required to take an oath or pledge when becoming Android Developers. However, we can still learn much from the principles behind the phrase, “First, do no harm.” In this talk, we will discuss over a dozen tools that are at your disposal as a developer which can enable you to provide high quality applications to your users. Thus allowing you to first, do no harm!",

Traditionally, this has involved using multiple toolkits and managing the complexity of costs and interactions across them. With Firebase Analytics, the process is unified (single toolkit), cost-effective (unlimited & free) and comprehensive (standard & custom events) — not to mention easy to use. In this talk, we will take a look at how easy it is to integrate Firebase Analytics and use the resulting insights to not just understand user behaviors, but also to improve user experience and engagement (with data-driven UX decisions) and to better monetize those interactions. The first half of the talk will focus on the Firebase Analytics API (front-end) and its usage (with code) to capture user events and establish relevant contexts. The second half of the talk will focus on the Firebase Analytics Dashboard (back-end) and its usage to filter, track and visualize user behaviors in individual and collective contexts. Finally, we will explore popular scenarios requiring behavior analytics and walk through how these can be implemented using the APIs and Dashboard provided by Firebase Analytics. The talk will conclude with pointers to resources, and a brief review of other Firebase features that enable (or are enabled by) Analytics.",

Announced at Google I/O 2014, Android Auto is Google’s attempt to bring Android to the car, with controls and a user interface optimized for driving. The first cars with Auto support were released in the summer of 2015 and Google has now opened up Android Auto to everyone with the recent release of the Android Auto app, giving developers a unique opportunity to reach a whole new set of users. The goal of this session is to get you started developing great apps for this emerging platform. We’ll talk about how to: Extend your existing audio or messaging app to be compatible with an Android Auto head unit; Use Android Auto to play music, compose and read messages and respond to user voice actions; Develop and test your apps with the Desktop Head Unit; Make sense of the Android Auto design guidelines and usability requirements that are in place for Auto apps;Distribute your Auto app through Google Play. Join us as we walk through real-life examples and see just how easy it is to get started with Android Auto!",

    "short-abstract": "In the 8 years since the release of the first commercial Android device, we’ve seen screen resolutions go from thousands of pixels to millions, cameras from 3MP to 13MP, and cores from 1 to 8 – but battery life is staying the same or even getting worse! This makes it even more important to be a good battery citizen and leave some juice for your users’ other apps (they do use apps other than yours, right?) In this session, we will explore the different battery tools and resources available for profiling – like Trepn Power Profiler and Battery Historian – and use them to identify common battery pain points in your app. We’ll also cover best practices for power-sensitive development so you can prevent battery drain problems from the beginning.",

In the United States, the same amount of data costs only 3.5 hours worth of minimum-wage-work. But, the hunger for Internet access and smartphones is not slowing down. By 2020, emerging markets will have more than 2.5 billion smartphone users and the demand for Internet access will increase by 500%. In his closing keynote, Nathan will address the importance of Internet access via smartphones and the powerful role that Android development plays in getting the next billion online, He will ultimately aim to inspire Android developers in Boston to create technologies that will change the future of the world’s economies.",

Do this as many times as necessary to get all objects.. oh, and order me a pizza’ (just kidding about the pizza).

Whilst at the beginning of a project lifecycle you are free and able to move quick, it’s the technical debt build up that will make it hard for both you and future developers to move fast and maintain your codebase. Clean Architecture allows you to create a codebase that is both easy to maintain and extend, whilst also opening up the ability to thoroughly test each layer of your codebase. Following Clean Architecture has made me discover the advantages that it can bring our projects. Coupled with the following of SOLID principles, codebases can not only become cleaner and well tested, but they can move in a direction that allows us move fast whilst remaining easy to work with at the same time. In this talk, we’ll be looking at what clean architecture is, why we should bring it on board and how we won’t be looking back.",

The best architecture, design patterns, libraries, tools, tips, tricks and common mistakes to avoid before writing the first line of code.  We follow with a review of how major companies develop mobile apps internally by exploring their open source projects and current publications regarding their latest advancements in native Android mobile development.

    "short-abstract": "This talk will give you an introduction to Processing for Android. It will cover the basics of the Processing language that allows to effectively program interactive graphics in 2D and 3D, and will describe the application of these techniques to different types of Android devices: smartphones, tablets, wearables and smartwatches, as well as to Cardboard-compatible devices in order to create VR experiences. Processing started in 2001 at the MIT Media lab as a project to increase software literacy in the arts and design, and today it is used around the world as a teaching and production tool. An advantage of Processing for Android over more complex programming environments is that it allows the users to focus on the interactions and visual output of their code rather than in the implementation details of the Android platform.",

    "short-abstract": "You find RoboGuice simple but slow? And you think Dagger 1 & 2 are fast but complex and bloated? Toothpick is the best of both worlds! Toothpick is a scope tree based, runtime but reflection free implementation of JSR 330. It is pure Java, with a special focus on Android. Toothpick is fast (even faster than Dagger 2 in some cases!) and is simpler to use, with less boilerplate code. Its syntax is very close to Guice. It supports named dependencies, lazy dependencies, providers, and has built-in support for custom scopes. As compared to Dagger 2, Toothpick provides more powerful testing support, allowing you to leverage DI to mock dependencies using either mockito or easymock. Its explicit scope tree helps developers to build more robust apps. It provides more fine grained control to easily implement complex user flows that span multiple activities or state preservation across configuration changes (e.g. rotations), a common issue when implementing the MVP pattern. During this talk for experts, we will introduce Toothpick, its main features and how it compares to other DI libs. We will explain how Toothpick scopes and scope annotations can solve advanced use cases when developing Android apps.",
