# Open Event Webapp

The Open Event Web App project has two components a) an event website generator and b) the actual generated website output. The web generator application can generate event websites by getting data from event JSON files and binary media files, that are stored in a compressed zip file. You can also access the application through a REST API. Websites that are generated by the "web app generator" can be uploaded to any web location, e.g. on Github pages or any server (e.g. via ftp).

## 1. Event Website Output

The component that is generator from the web app are the event websites. A sample event site using the [sample from the open-event repo](https://github.com/fossasia/open-event/tree/master/sample) was generated and added to this repo as a Github Pages site. You can see the live site at http://fossasia.github.io/open-event-webapp/

## 2. Web App Generator

### Components and Technology

#### Technologies used

The webapp generator uses the following technologies - 
 1. HTML/CSS/Javascript based frontend
 2. [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) - SASS to write optimized CSS.
 3. [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) - Javascript for the generator backend
 4. [Express.js](http://expressjs.com) - Server framework
 5. [Handelbars](http://handlebarsjs.com) - Template for rendering
 6. [Socket.io](http://socket.io) - For handling multi-user client, with progress of upload/generation

#### Components of the Generator

1. Webform

 The source of the webform can be found [here](/src/www). It consists of - 

 - [index.html](/src/www/index.html) - The webform page
 - [form.js](/src/www/js/form.js) - The script that uploads the zips, and starts the generator process
 
2. Generator

 The generator runs on a ExpressJS server, using this main [app script](/src/app.js). 

3. Scripts

 - [generator.js](/src/backend/generator.js) - Does the main generation tasks, and controls other scripts
 - [fold.js](/src/backend/fold.js) - Groups data of sessions, speakers, tracks etc from JSONs
 - [dist.js](/src/backend/dist.js) - Creates folders, cleans folders, unzips/zips packages
 - [ftpdeploy.js](/src/backend/ftpdeploy.js) - Deploys finished website to organiser's server (optional)
 - [mailer.js](/src/backend/mailer.js) - Sends mail to organiser notifying of successful creation
 - [buildlogger.js](/src/backend/buildlogger.js) - Displays build logs while generating webapp
 
4. Templates

 The HTML pages of the generated website are created using Handelbars templates. You can find all the templates [here](/src/backend/templates) - 

  - **footer.hbs** : Common template for footer on all pages
  - **navbar.hbs** : Common template for navbar on all pages
  - **event.hbs** : index.html - Home page
  - **rooms.hbs** : rooms.html - Venues page
  - **schedule.hbs** : tracks.html - Tracks page
  - **speakers.hbs** : speakers.html - Speakers page

## Accessing the Generator Web Form

 - Once deployed, you'll find the generator running on http://localhost:5000, it should look like this  

![Generator Screencast](docs/screenshots/screencast.gif)

 - Add your **email id**, **name of app** (name of event),

 - Then upload the zip file that contains all JSON files for *speakers*, *sessions*, *sponsors*, *event*, *tracks* and *locations* (These you should get from an orga-server or through the API after you have created your event there).

 - Now when you click on **GENERATE APP and DOWNLOAD** button, you'll get to download a zip of the event website.
