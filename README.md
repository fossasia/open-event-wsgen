# Open Event Webapp

The Open Event Web App is a web application that can generate event websites by getting data from JSON files and media files, that are stored in a compressed zip file. You can also access the application through a Rest API. Websites that are generated by the "web app generator" can be uploaded to any web location, e.g. on Github pages or any server (e.g. via ftp).

 - Add your **email id**, **name of app** (name of event),

 - Then upload the zip file that contains all JSON files for *speakers*, *sessions*, *sponsors*, *event*, *tracks* and *locations* (These you should get from an orga-server or through the API after you have created your event there).

 - Now when you click on **GENERATE APP and DOWNLOAD** button, you'll get to download a zip of the event website.

### Via REST API.
